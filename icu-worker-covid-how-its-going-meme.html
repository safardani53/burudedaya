She discussed the particulars of her career trajectory and day-to-day workflow with BuzzFeed, saying "Some shifts are eerily slow and quiet, while others are 12-plus hours of all-out chaos."</p><p>Kathryn graduated from nursing school in May, right around the height of the pandemic.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>How it started How it's going <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/cg32Tu7v0B</a></p>— kathedrals🇺🇸 (@kathryniveyy) <a href=#>November 22, 2020</a></figure><p>In her thread, she writes, "I love being a nurse.

I was drenched in sweat, my hair sticking straight up from the mask and face shield. The grooves left by the PPE on my face were deep and red, and I remember thinking that the reality of being a nurse was nothing like the ideas people seem to have of nurses in their heads, of cleanly pressed scrubs or white uniforms."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>How it started vs how it’s going 🙃 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/dMpeh4qsjV</a></p>— LYSS⚡️ (@lyssawulf) <a href=#>November 24, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>How it started —> how it is now <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2GgQlkkxUA</a></p>— Circus Nurse (@circus_nurse) <a href=#>November 24, 2020</a></figure><p>She doubled down on stating she wanted to share the effect the pandemic's had on humanity in an attempt to cut down on the politicizing of the virus, "I just wanted people to see what it's really like to take care of the patients that are at the heart of the pandemic that has somehow become a political flashpoint."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>How it started How it's going <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/KsshLDwU3M</a></p>— Sarah, RN (@shesinscrubs) <a href=#>November 24, 2020</a></figure><p>It didn't take long for other healthcare workers to share their own "how it started, how it's going memes", with many other people praising the nurse for being so candid about the effects of working such long hours in stringent conditions, no matter how unflattering the uploaded end result was.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Isn’t that what nurses do?
