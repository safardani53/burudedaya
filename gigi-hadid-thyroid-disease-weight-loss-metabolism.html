I have Hashimoto’s disease. It’s a thyroid disease,” the 21-year-old has revealed to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Elle</a> magazine. Hyperthyroidism can cause weight gain and depression, and the meds she’s on to combat it have caused her to lose weight.</p><h3><a href=# rel=nofollow>Shop TOMMYXGIGI Now — Free Shipping On $100+</a></h3><p id=content-paragraph-2>The supermodel realized that for the latest Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she was lacking the curves</a> that she did when she walked in 2015. “It’s now been two years since taking the medication for it, so for the VS show I didn’t want to lose any more weight. I just want to have muscles in the right place, and if my butt can get a little perkier, then that’s good.”</p><h3>Gigi Hadid: See pics of the supermodel</h3><p id=content-paragraph-3>It’s crazy that Gigi has to explain why she’s so skinny now because she had always been a champion for models with curves being accepted. In 2015&nbsp;she had to hit back at haters who said she was too heavy for the annual lingerie show, saying “I love my body because I know what it’s been through to be what it is, and honestly I’m not going to change for someone who is depressed about their life,” she told British <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vogue</a>.&nbsp;“The Victoria’s Secret Angels aren’t going anywhere; I’m not going anywhere; plus-sized models aren’t going anywhere,” she added.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>It was so refreshing to see Gigi’s sexy curves become the accepted norm in modeling, and she was so proud of it. &nbsp;She even wrote on Twitter in Sept. 2015 that, “I represent a body image that wasn’t accepted in high-fashion before, and I’m very lucky to be supported by the designers, stylists and editors that I am: ones that know this is fashion, it’s art; it can never stay the same.” We’re so sorry to hear that Gigi’s been battling a thyroid disease that has caused her to lose weight, but for goodness sakes we hope she doesn’t get any skinnier. Her beautiful athletic body was something we all envied!</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do you miss Gigi’s curvier body? Or do you think she looks better now?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlmZH5ze49xZqChl556qa3DoptmrJiuv7C1w2aboquVlsCmedaeoKCgpGK5sL%2FSZqSerJGXvK210qZm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
