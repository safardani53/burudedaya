I lost my best friend."</p><p>Haggas picked his words carefully when talking of Baaeed's potential, saying: "I would not go as far as to say he is the best horse in the world - that is the sort of thing others might say - but it was a strongish field and he did very well."</p><p>Baaeed may never reach Frankel's heights, but what is certain is that Sheikha Hissa - described as 'knowledgeable and passionate' by trainer Owen Burrows - was the perfect choice to honour her father's legacy.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>Wouldn't it be fitting if, under her, Shadwell produced their greatest horse ever.</p><p>Dad would be proud.</p><h4 id=free-bets-get-over-2-000-in-sign-up-offers-here>FREE BETS <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GET OVER £2,000 IN SIGN UP OFFERS HERE</a></h4><p>Commercial content notice: Taking one of the bookmaker offers featured in this article may result in a payment to The Sun. 18+.
