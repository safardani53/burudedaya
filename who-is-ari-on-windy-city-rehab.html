At just 15 years old, he took up woodworking alongside his father and grandfather and quickly developed a love and appreciation for artisan craftwork. This pedigree with wood isn't new to the family, however, as the website further states that Ari’s great-grandfather, a Czechoslovakian carpenter, passed down his woodworking traditions for generations.</p><p>Ari spent years honing his craft to the level that it is at today, and it seems as though his family's legacy will be continued for at least another generation. Ari's oldest son, Taner, has an active interest in woodworking and helps his father out in the shop alongside his two other brothers (when they're home from college). Taner's love for woodworking has gone so far that he has even started his own company, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taner Made</a>. Ari and his wife Lara have six children together.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sophisticated Living Chicago</a>, Ari got his start in the field by studying landscape architecture. However, he started a company of seven people before his education was done. In 1983 he dropped out of school to pursue his craftwork full-time, forming the basis for Hammer Design Group.</p><p>Hammer Design Group's mission is simple: We work with the best materials available and never compromise quality. We value honest hard work and deliver unique, hand-crafted pieces or experiences.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The official website notes that some of Hammer Design Group's projects have included the likes of prestigious hotels and restaurants such as The Graduate Hotel in Minneapolis, Minn., Built Burgers in Los Angeles, and Big Vinny’s in Chicago.</p><p>Nelson Ramirez works for Hammer Design Group and often appears on Windy City Rehab alongside Ari himself.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ari is also an accomplished painter and sculptor.</h2><p>When he isn't utilizing his skills with his hands to build, Ari's other pastimes include painting and sculpting. Several of his works of art appear on Windy City Rehab as well as on Rock the Block. He also has a number of works on display at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Main Street Gallery</a> in Park City, Utah.</p><p>His <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> has a sizable following of over 24,000 users and is growing by the day. On that platform, Ari shares information regarding his role on Windy City Rehab as well as his personal projects, snapshots with friends and family, and other tidbits about his life.</p><p>Be sure to check out new episodes of Windy City Rehab, airing Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET on HGTV.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZJqqmWK8r3nWoqWdsV2YtrXFjKucoZmS</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
