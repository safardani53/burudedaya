It is owned by Beiersdorf Global AG, based in Hamburg. The company was founded on March 28, 1886 by Paul Carl Beiersdorf. In 1890 it was sold to Oscar Troplowitz. Troplowitz worked with Beiersdorf colleague Dr Paul Gerson Unna and German chemist Isaac Lifschütz to develop a new skin care cream. In 1900, Lifschütz developed the first stable oil-in-water emulsion, Eucerit. This is the origin of Eucerin. Nivea comes from the Latin adjective niveus, nivea, niveum, which means "white snow". During the 1930s, Beiersdorf produced a wide variety of products such as skin dyes, shaving creams, shampoos, cleansers and toners. During World War II, the label "NIVEA" was confiscated in many countries. After the war, Beiersdorf acquired the copyright. During the 1980s, the NIVEA brand had spread to the broader global market.</p><table class=wikibox readability=2.5><tr><td class=wk_label>Product type</td><td class=wk_value>Skin and body care</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Owner</td><td class=wk_value>Beiersdorf AG</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Country</td><td class=wk_value>Germany</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Introduced</td><td class=wk_value>1911</td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=wk_label>Related brands</td><td class=wk_value>Eucerin, Aquaphor, Labello, Coppertone</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Markets</td><td class=wk_value>Worldwide</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.allfamous.org/people/headshots/nivea-mmdk-allfamous.org-1.jpg><p>R&B Singer Nivea was born on March 24, 1982 in Savannah, Georgia, United States (She's 41 years old now).</p><p>The American R&B artist's early 2000s singles included"Laundromat" and"Don't Mess with My Man".</p><p>All information about Nivea can be found in this post.
