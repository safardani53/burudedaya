Fans would know the airport outing comes just a couple of weeks after the BET Awards, where she shared the news that she and Offset were going to be parents for the second time. She did so by joining&nbsp; <strong>Migos</strong> to perform “Type Sh-t,” arriving on stage in a bedazzled bodysuit which featured an exposed mesh panel over her stomach.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>After performing, Cardi shared a photo from a pregnancy shoot, confirming the fact that her daughter <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kulture Ciara Cephus</a> </strong>was getting a younger sibling.
