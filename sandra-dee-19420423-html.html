Dee began her career as a child model, working first in commercials, and then film in her teenage years. Best known for her portrayal of ingénues, Dee earned a Golden Globe Award as one of the year's most promising newcomers for her performance in Robert Wise's Until They Sail. She became a teenage star for her performances in Imitation of Life and Gidget, which made her a household name. By the late 1960s, her career had started to decline, and a highly publicized marriage to Bobby Darin ended in divorce. The year of her divorce, Dee's contract with Universal Pictures was dropped. She attempted a comeback with the 1970 independent horror film The Dunwich Horror, but rarely acted after this time, appearing only occasionally in television productions throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Dee's final years were marred by illness, and she died in 2005 of complications from kidney disease, brought on by a lifelong struggle with anorexia nervosa.</p><table class=wikibox readability=8><tr readability=7><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>Alexandra Zuck, April 23, 1942, Bayonne, New Jersey, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Died</td><td class=wk_value>February 20, 2005, Thousand Oaks, California, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Resting place</td><td class=wk_value>Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Other names</td><td class=wk_value>Sandra Douvan</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Occupation</td><td class=wk_value>Actress, model</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Years active</td><td class=wk_value>1957–1983</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Children</td><td class=wk_value>1</td></tr></table><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.allfamous.org/people/headshots/sandra-dee-vksk-allfamous.org-1.jpg><p>Movie Actress Sandra Dee was born in Bayonne, New Jersey, United States on April 23, 1942.
