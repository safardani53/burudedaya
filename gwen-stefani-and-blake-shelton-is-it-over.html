"She’s heartbroken."</p><p>Of course she is — Blake is only, what, her third serious relationship that she’s ever had in her life? This is a woman who loves with her whole heart.</p><p>"She continues to send him loving social media support from LA while he’s been out on the road."</p><p>Which explains her continued social media posts about missing him while he’s on his tour.</p><p>"But Blake has drastically slowed regular communication with her."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>The report goes on to claim Blake’s motives for breaking up with his better half, which really drives home the rumor that <a href=#>Blake is high on fame and money</a> after his time on The Voice.</p><p>"Blake’s through with Gwen’s neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband and her jealousy of him and other women."</p><p>Remember, it was rumored that <a href=#>Blake was cheating with Chloe Kohanski</a>.</p><p>Of course she couldn’t resist People’s "Sexiest Man Alive." (I’m kidding)</p><p>"She told him she didn’t want to spend her life in fear of her famous partner cheating on her."</p><p>After what Gwen went through with Gavin, that’s a very understandable fear. Especially since it was rumored that Blake cheated on Miranda just as much as she did on him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Here is how the split allegedly went down.</p><p>"Blake told Gwen that he was going to be doing the latter part of the monthlong Country Freaks Tour without her."</p><p>That’s not a good sign.</p><p>"Gwen was so used to accompanying him on tour, she was upended."</p><p>Plenty of partners would enjoy a break like that, but not Gwen and not under these circumstances.</p><p>"After their nastiest argument ever, Blake took off without even saying goodbye."</p><p>That sounds really grim.</p><p>"It was a real breaking point in the relationship."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>To top it all off, this same report claims that Blake is connecting with his ex.</p><p>"Miranda reached out to Blake via text."</p><p>A couple of weeks ago, the world heard a report that <a href=#>Miranda Lambert and Anderson East have broken up</a>.</p><p>Which would mean that Miranda is now single and ready to mingle … or fall back on old habits.</p><p>"Ultimately, they buried the hatchet and have been supporting each other through their latest troubled relationships."</p><p>That doesn’t mean that things are necessarily turning intimate again, though.</p><p>"They’ve become close friends and allies over the past month or so."</p><p>So, despite their nasty breakup a few years back, now they’re becoming friends again.</p><p>"They have developed into close confidantes and are sharing intimate details of their lives."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>To be clear, it isn’t 100% certain that Miranda Lambert and Anderson East have split … though they haven’t exactly jumped at the chance to shout from the rooftops that the report of their breakup is false.</p><p>Similarly, right now, we just have speculation from social media and this illuminating report on Gwen and Blake.</p><p>But until anything is announced, reports that the two had a fight aren’t the same thing as confirmation of a breakup.</p><p>Perhaps, as they go their separate ways, cooler heads will prevail.</p><p>It is nice to imagine the kind of music that Gwen Stefani might make if she’s inspired by a split from Blake Shelton, whom many have seen as little more than a bloated parasite clinging to Gwen’s underbelly to siphon away a bit of her fame.</p><p>But the two may reconcile as if they never had a fight in the first place, folks. It happens all of the time.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Blake Shelton Celebrates 40th Birthday With Gwen Stefani: PHOTOS</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WAcLPWnqVmq6Sas6K6yGaYp5xdl7mit8RmqqGdnKm8r3nIrGSirF2kw6a%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
