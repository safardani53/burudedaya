She wore a sparkling Chanel top with the designer’s logo all over it, and a lighter shade of purple leggings as well as a silver pair of open-toed high heels. She accessorized with a pair of pink-shaded glasses by <strong>James Oro</strong> and a bunch of silver jewelry, including a giant sparkling necklace with the Playboy bunny. Offset meanwhile went for a total rockstar look with matching leather jackets and pants (with a giant chain hanging off of it), as well as boots and a white-shirt. He definitely seemed like he had a great time at dinner, as he was seen grabbing the “Up” rapper’s rear end, as he helped her into a car.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Offset-Grabs-Cardi-B-Butt-Dinner-BACKGRID-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Hopefully Cardi had a wonderful birthday dinner, as it’s been quite an eventful year for her.

Cardi has opened up about how she’s<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> felt after giving birth</a> to her son in a September tweet. “Can’t wait till these weird postpartum hormones completely leave my body,” she wrote. “I be crying for no reason.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>After giving birth, Cardi has<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> looked great</a> during her public outings since her son was born. Her and Offset have shown off plenty of stylish outfits during a recent trip to Paris, like when Cardi wore a sexy <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Zebra print outfit</a> or an <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>eye-catching tabloid headline-covered</a> dress.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH5xe5BqZqielqiytXnGq5ibq12YrrOwyGaZZpqlqcFusMinpZ6qXaW1sMDOrGY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
