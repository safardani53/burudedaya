In fact, it felt almost overdue.</p><p>"Vanessa is extremely close to her family in Montreal, and is very connected to her community and her work there," the source said.</p><p>"Moving to Los Angeles," where Nick has officially taken up residence, "or elsewhere long term was never really on the table for her."</p><p>"Unfortunately," laments the source, despite some of his comments, "it seems as though Nick never had any intention of moving to Montreal."</p><p>"Vanessa’s not really into the whole fame thing," the source adds. "She’s had some fun with it, but that’s not what she’s about."</p><p>"Ultimately, they want different things."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/vanessa-and-nick-viall-together-682x1024.jpg><p>Raise your hand if you’re surprised.</p><p>Anyone? Hello? Not one hand?!</p><p>We don’t know Nick personally, so we can’t comment on whether his intentions were pure, but to any viewer, this much was pretty obvious:</p><p>He, more than most Bachelor or Bachelorette stars, was enamored with the publicity, fame, spotlight and career opportunities that resulted.</p><p>Contrast that with Vanessa, who was at the opposite end of the spectrum, and it’s sort of a small wonder they lasted as long as they did.</p><p>Nick went immediately from The Bachelor to Dancing With the Stars, which wouldn’t be the kiss of relationship death in and of itself.</p><p>That almost seemed like the goal for him, however, to use The Bachelor as a jump-off point to build his own brand and life in Los Angeles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Grimaldi, meanwhile, always felt like a fish out of water there and missed Canada, where the source believes she’ll be back in no time.</p><p>An additional insider added that "Vanessa is an extremely down-to-earth girl and truly wanted that happily-ever-after with Nick."</p><p>"They both put in a lot of work in the relationship and care a lot for each other," the source continued, somewhat defending Viall.</p><p>"However, time proved that they were better off parting ways in the end. It wasn’t the distance or the limelight [that caused this]."</p><p>"They just weren’t the best match for each other."</p><p>Fellow members from Bachelor Nation questioned the couple’s compatibility as Vanessa seemed to keep them all at a distance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Jasmine Goode and Danielle Lombard, two women who also sought Nick’s roses on The Bachelor, said she went radio silent.</p><p>Goode said that was highly unusual for her:</p><p>"I think Taylor talks to [Vanessa], I think Danielle [Maltby] does. I’ve seen [Vanessa] here and there. There’s no hard feelings, you know?" &nbsp;</p><p>As for whether Goode thought Viall was just acting, she said "sometimes" felt that way, or at least, "I think he was just playing it up, you know?"</p><p>Lombard, a.k.a. the <a href=#>Hottest Woman Alive on Bachelor in Paradise</a>, added that she has not heard from Vanessa since the season ended.</p><p>"Vanessa and I don’t have a great relationship and I think after things happened with Nick, we just parted ways," she explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"In terms of whether or not I [thought] their relationship would last, I don’t know," she said, adding that body language might say a lot.</p><p>"I think their relationship is very different than other, past Bachelor Nation couples," she added. "They seem to be a little bit more serious."</p><p>"At least compared to what I’ve seen from Rachel [Lindsay] and Bryan [Abasolo], or Kaitlyn [Bristowe] and Shawn [Booth]."</p><p>"Yeah, it seems a lot less playful."</p><p>Many fans were calling this the moment Nick and Vanessa came out on the After the Final Rose special following his season finale.</p><p>They seemed … less than happy.</p><p>Sometimes we read too much into such appearances, which are both emotional and awkward. Doesn’t look like this was one of those times.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Bachelor Nation: Are ANY of These Couples Are Still Together?</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2WFcLrInKJmrpmWua15wKebZq6Ro7K0v8BmnquhnZa5pbWMsJ%2ByZZSesW7Ax56wZqugoba1ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
