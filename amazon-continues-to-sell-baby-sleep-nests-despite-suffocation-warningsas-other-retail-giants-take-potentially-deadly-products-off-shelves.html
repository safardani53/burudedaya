Using this type of product to hold an infant on his or her side or back is dangerous".</p><p>"The federal government has received reports about babies who have died from suffocation associated with their sleep positioners," it said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000358396998.jpg><p>"In most of these cases, the babies suffocated after rolling from their sides to their stomachs.</p><p>"In addition to reports about deaths, the federal government also has received reports about babies who were placed on their backs or sides in positioners - but were later found in other, dangerous positions within or next to these products."</p><p>The Lullaby Trust baby charity said: "There are hundreds of baby sleep products on the market and parents assume that if something is for sale it is safe to use.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000358397137.jpg><p>"We do not recommend wedges and sleep positioners as evidence shows that the safest way for a baby to sleep is on a firm, flat mattress, in a clear cot free of pillows, toys, bumpers and sleep positioners.</p><p>"Babies are at higher risk of sudden infant death syndrome if they have their heads covered and some items added to a cot may increase the risk of head-covering and can also increase the risk of accidents.</p><p>"We recommend that, while evidence on individual products is not widely available, parents do not take any chances and stick to scientifically proven safer sleep guidelines."</p><p>A spokeswoman for Boots said: "At Boots UK, the quality and safety of the products we sell is of the utmost importance to us.</p><p>"We are removing the sale of all sleep positioner products whilst we investigate further with our suppliers."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><br><p><b>We pay for your stories!
