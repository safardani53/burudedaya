"I loved alcohol and it got to the point where even I started to, you know, cancel nights out that I felt like I wouldn't be able to control myself."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>became co-founder and partner</a> of Kin in September after finding that it helped with her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>anxiety</a>, the brain fog from her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Lyme disease</a>, and the burnout from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>constant work and travel</a>. The alcohol-free, botanical-infused seltzer brand claims to enhance focus and creativity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't feel the need [to drink alcohol] because I know how it will affect me at 3 in the morning when I wake up with horrible anxiety thinking about that one thing I said five years ago when I graduated high school," said Hadid. "There's just this never-ending effect of, essentially, you know, pain and stress over those few drinks that didn't really do much, you know?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hadid previously <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>got candid about her mental health</a> in November when she posted photos of herself crying. "Social media is not real. For anyone struggling, please remember that," she wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Sometimes all you've gotta hear is that you're not alone. So from me to you, you're not alone. I love you, I see you, and I hear you. Self help and mental illness/chemical imbalance is not linear and it is almost like a flowing rollercoaster of obstaclesâ€¦ it has its ups and downs, and side to sides," she added. "But I want you to know, there is always light at the end of the tunnel, and the rollercoaster always comes to a complete stop at some point."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The model was previously <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>arrested and charged with a DUI</a> in 2014, for which she was given six months of probation, 25 hours of community service, and 20 hours of Alcoholic Anonymous meetings, in addition to having her license suspended for a year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bella Hadid</a> Seemingly Confirms New Relationship with Mystery Man on Instagram</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Earlier this week, Hadid celebrated Kin arriving on the shelves of Erewhon Market by posting a photo of herself grocery shopping in style.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"God is Good!!!!
