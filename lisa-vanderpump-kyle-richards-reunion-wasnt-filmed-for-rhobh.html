Now, Us can reveal that Lisa and Kyle spotted each other at a store in Beverly Hills, but cameras did not capture their conversation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Lisa-Vanderpump-Kyle-Richards-Reunion-RHOBH-01.jpg><p>Lisa spoke to Us at the launch of Baskin-Robbins Mother’s Day Fancy Cone Dessert on Wednesday, May 8, about seeing Kyle for the first time in months.</p><p>“I actually ran into Kyle the other day,” she told Us. “It was OK.”</p><p>The SUR owner and the former child actress<a href=#> had not seen or spoken to each other</a> since their ugly fight at Villa Rosa, which aired on the April 2 episode of RHOBH. The two<a href=#> women went head to head over Lisa’s alleged role in leaking the story</a> about <a href=#><strong>Dorit Kemsley</strong></a>’s dog to the press.</p><p>The <a href=#>dramatic argument</a> ended with the <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules </a>star’s husband, <strong>Ken Todd</strong>, kicking Kyle out of their house.</p><p>“I was very shocked because he’s always been kind to me,” Kyle told Us in February about Ken’s actions. “I’ve always been a big fan and supporter of his, always. It was hurtful more than anything.”</p><p>She added: “Someone who was speaking their truth didn’t deserve that reaction. I was not attacking, I was just speaking my truth and that reaction was just so extreme that I was very taken back.”</p><p>After the episode aired last month, Lisa <a href=#>seemingly declared that her friendship with Kyle could not be salvaged.</a></p><p>“[The day after the fight], I received a text sending me a birthday greeting from KR, a hollow statement, it felt insincere to me – there were no flowers, no phone call, no messages of retraction,” Lisa wrote in a blog post on April 16. “I pressed the BLOCK button … Problem solved.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lisa concluded: “She threw our relationship down the toilet and I flushed it!”</p><p>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills airs on Bravo Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaloaOWeretzZ2cq6ilor1ut9ilnGaqmZi1or7DrGSrnaWjtrC6jLCYrKakYrOquMyem2aen6d6s7TOm59o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
