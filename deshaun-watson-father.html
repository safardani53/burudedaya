Unlike most kids, the NFL player has his mother’s last name as she was raised alone.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, many sources have claimed that Watson never even met his father. Nevertheless, Don has been absent from his kids’ lives since they were young.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, Deshaun and his siblings grew up without a fatherly presence in their lives, and the family depended on their mother’s income for a living. They used to live in a government-run apartment.</p><p>However, the neighborhood was not the best place to grow up, as many drug dealers and gang members resided there. So the QB tried his best to focus on school and football and getting out of there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Deshaun-Watson-Mother.jpg><p>Once Deshaun brought a Habitat for Humanity flyer after hearing about the program.&nbsp; Shortly after, the Watson family was gifted a new home by former NFL running back Warrick Dunn through the organization.&nbsp;</p><h3>Raised By A Single Mom</h3><p>Rook was a very dedicated student and did his best to help his mother. However, things got terrible when Deann was diagnosed with stage five tongue cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>At the time, Deshaun was in high school, and his whole world turned upside down. As a result, all the household and financial responsibilities fell on the athlete’s shoulders and his older brother, Detrick.</p><p>Not to mention, the footballer worked four jobs to keep the family afloat while his mother was battling cancer. Eventually, Deann kicked cancer to the curb, and Deshaun made it through high school.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You Might Be Interested In NFL Quarterback <a href=# rel=noopener>Jimmy Garoppolo Bio: Contract, Wife, Injury & Trade >></a></strong></p><h3>Education And NFL Draft</h3><p>While graduating from Gainesville High School, his high school coach suggested he should think about a career in football as he saw a lot of potential in Watson. But, until then, the NFL player never believed he could get into the league.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, he had a tremendous collegiate career at Clemson University with the Clemson Tigers and won many awards and honors. Shortly after, several media outlets and experts considered Rook a top prospect and a first-round pick in the 2017 NFL Draft.&nbsp;</p><p>The Houston Texans drafted him as the 12th pick overall in the first round. Coincidentally, Warrick Dunn, who helped him get a house through Habitat for Humanity, is also a 12th pick overall.&nbsp;</p><p>Although growing up without a father was challenging and brought struggles for Watson, even though he managed to make the best.</p><p>Instead of seeing the problems in his life as problems, the athlete saw them as opportunities to grow and build himself up.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Don’t Forget To Check Out Quarterback&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Mac Jones’s Bio: Stats, NFL Draft, Patriots & Net Worth >></a></strong></p><h2>Deshaun Watson Father | Age, Height, And Weight</h2><p>Since there is minimal information on Deshaun Watson’s father’s birth and physique, his details like age, height, and weight are unknown.

Likewise, he is 6 ft 2 inches (1.88 m) tall and weighs 215 lb (98 kg).&nbsp;</p><h2>Deshaun Watson Father | Professional Career</h2><p>As the Watson family rarely talks about Don and his career, we do not know what the player’s father does for a living.</p><p>On the other hand, his oldest son Tyreke worked at the clothing and apparel company Diamond Supply Co while Detrick worked at Gainesville Housing Authority. Likewise, Deshaun Watson is a well-known NFL player for the Houston Texans.</p><p>The Texans team drafted him in the first round of the 2017 NFL Draft as the 12th pick. The QB had a tremendous collegiate career, making him a top prospect for the draft.&nbsp;</p><p>He was the 2016 CFP National Champion and CFP National Championship Offensive MVP.

However, the Texans have named him a backup player for the 2021 NFL season.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though Rook requested a trade, the Houston team has no intentions of trading or negotiating a transaction. Moreover, as of now, many of Watson’s endorsers have terminated their contracts with him.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, due to the steep amount of allegations against the player, his promising career in the NFL does not seem very bright.&nbsp;</p><p>Much attention has been paid to Deshaun Watson’s suspension from the Cleveland Browns in 2022.</p><p>However, the $5 million fine that comes with Watson’s negotiated 11-game suspension is important for a few reasons.</p><p>Deshaun is the first player to be fined under the NFL’s personal conduct policy.</p><p><strong>Click To Know <a href=# rel=noopener>Deshaun Watson Is In a Great Abyss Regarding His Current Sexual Allegations >></a></strong></p><h2>Deshaun Watson Father | Girlfriend, Wife, And Marriage</h2><p>The only known relationship of Deshaun Watson’s father is with his mother, Deann.
