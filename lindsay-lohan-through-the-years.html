Following the movie’s success, she scored a three-film contract with Disney.</p><p>“I was 10 when I did Parent Trap,” Lohan recalled to Rolling Stone in 2004. “I left school for eight months. When I came back, my friends were like, ‘Where’d you go?’ I said, ‘My family and I went on a long vacation.’ Then the movie came out, and they were like, ‘Um, Lindsay? That’s you in Parent Trap.’ And I said, ‘Oh, yeah. I also did this movie while we were gone.’”</p><p>While Lohan’s success in Hollywood continued with the release of Mean Girls in 2004, <a href=#>her personal issues began to overshadow her career</a>. The “Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)” songstress appeared in court more than 20 times amid her substance abuse struggles from 2007 to 2012.</p><p>“I got arrested for my first DUI when I was 20 and they found me with drugs,” Lohan told <a href=#><strong>Piers Morgan</strong> </a>in 2013. “And from then on the press were on me all the time. It was the first time I’d taken drugs; I was out in a club with people I shouldn’t have been with, and took cocaine, and got in the car. It was so stupid.”</p><p>While reflecting on some of her darkest hours, Lohan revealed at the time that she had no regrets about her troubled past.</p><p>“I believe things happen for a reason,” she said in 2013. ”I live without regrets. There are certain things I have done, mistakes that I made, that I would change, but I don’t regret them at all, because I’ve learned from them.”</p><p>After taking a break from acting, Lohan shifted her focus to opening nightclubs overseas. In December 2019, the Herbie: Fully Loaded star announced she had plans for a Hollywood comeback.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’m managing my sister, so I want to really focus on me and everything that I can do in my life and come back to America and start filming again, which I’m doing something soon in this new year,” she told <a href=#><strong>Andy Cohen</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Anderson Cooper</strong> </a>on CNN’s New Year’s Eve special. “And, you know, just taking back the life I’ve worked so hard for and sharing it with my family and you guys.”</p><p>Scroll through to see photos of Lohan through the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuaq6w6yYsmWcpLWiuoytn6unpZy1bsDHnmSynZGnwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
