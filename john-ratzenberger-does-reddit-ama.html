So we’re sharing them with you.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>1. His favorite Cliff fact is the buffalo theory</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And here it is, in full:</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Well ya see, Norm, it’s like this… A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo. And when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest members.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In much the same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, as we know, kills brain cells. But naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient machine. That’s why you always feel smarter after a few beers.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>2. The cast wasn’t drinking real beer</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This is perhaps obvious – anyone drinking real beer throughout a day of filming likely wouldn’t be able to read lines, much less even stay on a bar stool. That said, we were interested to know that the cast was drinking a non-alcoholic beverage called “Near Beer,” which Ratzenberger says “tasted horrible.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>3. He received angry letters from mailmen about Cliff</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ratzenberger says he “did get a couple of angry letters from postmen saying I shouldn’t have been wearing my keys in the bar.” However, ” after the Postmaster General Anthony Franks did a guest spot on the show, the letters stopped.”</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>4. His favorite episode is the one where Cliff dates Diane</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Well “dates” is his word. He does try to seduce her in his car by singing “Misty,” though it doesn’t work. (The episode is called “Cliffie’s Big Score.”)</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>5. This is his favorite Norm joke</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cliff: “Hey Norm, how’s it going?” Norm: “It’s a dog eat dog world and I’m wearing Milk Bone underwear.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Other gems: Ratzenberger’s favorite voiceover character was Hammy the Pig from Toy Story; “peanut butter and bacon” makes the perfect pita; and he once taught carpentry to children in London.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We learned so much today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5Oauaau0aKrsmeapLWvedGaq7Odnpeys7PEq2Sdp5WoerOxw52grWWRoq5w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
