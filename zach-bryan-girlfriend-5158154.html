He released his debut album&nbsp;DeAnn,&nbsp;which was dedicated to his late mother, in 2019. His third album and major label debut was&nbsp;American Heartbreak,&nbsp;and he followed it up with the live record&nbsp;All My Homies Hate Ticketmaster,&nbsp;which was recorded at Colorado’s Red Rocks Amphitheater. He dropped his fourth album&nbsp;Zach Bryan&nbsp;on Aug. 25, 2023, and he subsequently announced a tour to follow it, with tickets going on presale on Sept. 6, 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/zach-bryan-girlfriends.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>With many of his songs detailing love and romance, Zach’s own relationships have sparked interest amongst his fans. Most recently, he’s been linked to podcaster&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Brianna LaPaglia</a>,&nbsp;</strong>24, and she’s spoken about their romance on Barstool’s BFFs podcast. Find out more about Zach’s relationship with Brianna and his prior marriage here.</p><h2>Brianna LaPaglia</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/zach-bryan-girlfriend-brianna-lapaglia-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Zach has been dating Brianna, who is also known by her online handle&nbsp;<strong>Brianna Chickenfry,&nbsp;</strong>since July 2023. Besides the&nbsp;BFFs&nbsp;podcast, Brianna is also a social media star, who went viral on Vine and now has 2 million followers on TikTok. She also hosts the podcast&nbsp;Plan Bri Uncut.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>While the “Something in the Orange” singer and podcaster have only been dating since July, Brianna did detail that they met at the<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Academy of Country Music Awards in May 2023</a> in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>vlog</a>. “All I want to do is meet Zach Bryan,” she said early in the clip. She detailed meeting him and later described him as “The nicest man I have ever met in my entire life.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>After the ACMs, Brianna revealed that she attended Zach’s New York City concert with her then-boyfriend, and they went on-stage during the concert. After the show, she revealed that she had made a podcast, shouting him out, and he slid into her DMs to say he appreciated it on her&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>BFFs</a>&nbsp;podcast. In July, she said that the two of them were spending time together and it was “fun” and “casual” on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Plan Bri Uncut</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>In August, the podcaster revealed that she and Zach were dating on the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>BFFs podcast.</a> Barstool owner&nbsp;<strong>Dave Portnoy&nbsp;</strong>“grilled” her on the podcast, giving her a hard time since she didn’t go public with him on their show. When she clarified their relationship timeline, she revealed that the first time they really spent time together, they went on an 18-hour car ride and talked the entire home. “He’s like the nicest, most genuine person I’ve ever met. He’s so normal,” she said. “This guy’s actually awesome.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>When Zach dropped his self-titled album, fans were looking for any signs of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Brianna</a>, and her podcast co-hosts revealed that she was there when he recorded one of the songs. What appears to be her laugh could be heard in the background of his song “Smaller Acts,” which was apparently recorded as a voice memo in a field. Even though she didn’t really confirm or deny whether the laugh was hers, Brianna said that the song wasn’t about her. “He recorded it on his phone,” she said on the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>podcast</a>. “It’s not about me. I was just there when he recorded it.”</p><h2>Deb Peifer</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Before hitting it off with Brianna Chickenfry, Zach was in a relationship with <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deb Peifer</a>.&nbsp;</strong>The pair were together for about 18 months when they called it quits in May 2023, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six</a>.&nbsp;Prior to their split, Deb had shared tons of photos of the two of them on her social media, including the two of them at a football game for Zach’s beloved Philadelphia Eagles. Since the split, she seems to have deleted them.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>For transparency and with respect I am letting everyone know Debra and me went our separate ways about a week and a half ago.

Things are mutual between us, we’re leaving with plenty memories and good times. I beg so much that everyone respects her and my privacy through a hard time,” he wrote.</p><h2>Rose Madden</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Before he rose to fame, Zach was briefly married to Naval Officer&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rose Madden</a>.&nbsp;</strong>He revealed that they’d tied the knot when he responded to a fan asking for new merch in a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweet</a>. “Ya sorry brother had to get married that’s my bad,” he joked. With his two new relationships, it’s clear that Zach and Rose have split up. Neither has publicly addressed the split, but they’ve cleared photos of each of them from their social media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9mamqFlkqfGorqMoKCrpJantqa6w2Zsam1oZoJ1ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
