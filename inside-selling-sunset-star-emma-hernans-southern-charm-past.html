If you thought <a href=#><strong>Emma Hernan</strong></a>’s first experience with reality TV was when she joined <a href=#>Selling Sunset </a>in 2021, you’d be in good company — until an eagle-eyed fan unearthed the Netflix personality’s past appearance on <a href=#>Southern Charm</a>.</p><p>“Wonder where you’ve seen Emma from Selling Sunset before??” a TikTok user shared in a clip posted Thursday, April 28. “Season 3 episode 9 of Southern Charm circa 2016.”</p><p>Indeed, the season 3 episode “Hold Your Horses,” which aired in April 2016, featured Hernan, 30, being introduced to <a href=#><strong>Craig Conover</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Shep Rose</strong></a>. “Are you all California girls?” Rose, 41, asked. “Sometimes, there’s too many options,” he later quipped to the camera.</p><p>This is far from the only headline the Oppenheim Group agent has made of late. On Monday, April 25, Hernan clarified the juicy confession she made about <a href=#><strong>Ben Affleck</strong> </a>on a recent episode of Selling Sunset. (Season 5 of the hit dropped on Netflix on April 22.)</p><p>In the episode, the realtor told costar <a href=#><strong>Chrishell Stause</strong></a> that she and the Argo director, 49, <a href=#>had been “texting” after matching on the celebrity dating app Raya</a>. The two bonded over their home state of Massachusetts, and “he may or may not have asked to grab … coffee a few times,” Hernan revealed.</p><a title=@allymanor href=#>@allymanor</a><p>My brain is filled with useless pop culture facts for your entertainment 🫠💛 <a title=sellingsunset href=#>#sellingsunset</a> <a title=southerncharm href=#>#southerncharm</a></p><p><a title="♬ original sound - Ally Manor" href=#>♬ original sound – Ally Manor</a></p><p>After the episode aired, however, Affleck — who has been in a relationship with fiancée <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a> since May 2021 — explained via his rep that he hadn’t been <a href=#>an “active member” on Raya</a> “for several years.”</p><p>Hernan <a href=#>appeared to confirm this herself</a> when she explained on E!’s Daily Pop that the interaction with the Oscar winner “was not recent. This was 2019. Literally, the smallest, innocent little thing. … [It] blew up out of proportion.”</p><p>Her rep clarified the situation to Us Weekly, noting, “Ben and Emma’s Raya interaction occurred in 2019. They matched, they exchanged messages, they never met.”</p><p>Throughout season 5 of Selling Sunset, the Netflix star found herself in <a href=#>even more sticky situations</a> with her dating life.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I never flirt with clients. I am always strictly business, but it’s hard not to flirt with Micah,” Hernan said of property developer <a href=#><strong>Micah McDonald</strong></a>. “I usually don’t mix business with pleasure, but Micah’s a little bit different. We had like one or two meetings, and I was like, ‘Oh, my God. Not only is he attractive and successful and confident, but we actually have a lot in common. I mean, basically he’s just, like, check, check, checking every damn box.’”</p><p>The prior season — Hernan’s first — the Netflix star duked it out with costar <a href=#><strong>Christine Quinn</strong> </a>over their mutual ex and fellow Oppenheim agent, <a href=#><strong>Peter Cornell</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKCnq5mZsm6%2FxKWjoqaXYsC2utKeq2arpJa%2FbrHMpphmoJWnu6K60maqqK2knbKzuoycn5qqnWK9or%2FTaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
