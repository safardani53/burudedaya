I heard the rumors they don't let filming inside … maybe because the little babe is inside," the poster of the clip suggested.</p><p>However, not all fans were on board as another follower claimed that the <a href=#>TLC</a> notable may simply have a medical condition that has led to body changes.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="read more sister wives">read more sister wives</h2><p>Previously, fans have also wondered why <a href=#>Robyn</a>, 45, and her co-stars usually film their exchanges outside her home and never indoors.</p><p>"Why isn’t Robyn getting filmed inside her house?" one viewer shared on an online thread dedicated to the series.</p><p>A person responded at the time: "Secret baby. It’s my favorite 'conspiracy theory...'"</p><p>"Was there a rumor a while back that Robyn was pregnant? I've since heard about nannies and refusing to film her children or house. Could her having more and more kids be what's behind a lot of it?" another shared.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2><strong>MOTHERHOOD</strong></h2><p>Robyn had three kids: son Dayton, 23, and daughters Aurora, 21, and Breanna, 18, with her ex-husband <a href=#>David Jessop</a>, who she was married to from 1999 to 2007.</p><p>Robyn's current husband, Kody, legally adopted all three children when the couple tied the knot.</p><p>They also have two biological children: Solomon, 11, and Ariella, 7.</p><p>Earlier this month, Kody and Robyn were spotted in Flagstaff, <a href=#>Arizona</a>, in <a href=#>exclusive photos obtained by The U.S. Sun</a>.</p><p>The stars were seen as they entered a school, presumably for a meeting for one of their two younger children.</p><p>In the snaps, Kody had his arm around Robyn's waist as they walked side-by-side into the school.</p><p>The father-of-18 wore a plum-colored T-shirt and denim jeans, while his fourth wife opted for a royal blue shirt and black jeans.</p><p>They were later seen exiting the school in a lighter mood as Kody was seen laughing at something Robyn was explaining.</p><h2><strong>NANNY DRAMA</strong></h2><p>Just days later, the couple's nanny, <a href=#>Mindy Jessop</a>, was also captured driving their children to school in exclusive photos by The U.S. Sun.</p><p>Mindy is known for being a nanny for the pair's younger kids as well as being Robyn's step-niece.</p><p>Fans were not happy, however, as one wrote at the time: "Can Kody and Robyn really not take care of two kids on their own?"</p><p>Another stated: "I wonder why Robyn can’t seem to manage her kids by herself. Why would you need to take your nanny on a family outing?</p><p>"It’s not like they are both babies, or there are more children than parents."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Meanwhile, three of Kody's wives have moved on from him as second spouse <a href=#>Christine</a>, 51, is now <a href=#>married to David Woolley</a>.</p><p><a href=#>Janelle</a>, his third wife, and first wife <a href=#>Meri</a> has also parted ways from the longtime TV star.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/robyn-kody-episode-tlcs-sister-569633500.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/shot-us-sun-exclusive-pics-851325696-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/10/sister-wives-cast-sister-wives-602549480.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hxZGx9cYCYaKqiq6Sav27DyK%2BcrGWipK%2B6uoybqaivnmK9s7HGp5inrF2Yubax0matopyVpHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
