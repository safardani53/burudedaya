The 37-year-old musician described rushed Jago to the Accident and Emergency (A&E) Room after he aspirated some water from the pool as a “terrifying ordeal.”</p><p>The musician explained what occurred in a lengthy Instagram statement, warning his fans of the frightening condition:</p><p>“Jago is a good swimmer for his age, and he was swimming under water when he came out sputtering and choking. He was never left alone. It was just for a little while, nothing out of the ordinary for children.”</p><p>Later, though, Jago became “lethargic” and began projectile vomiting after supper, prompting him to be brought to the hospital.&nbsp;According to Banner Health, when people inhale water while swimming or suffer near drowning, they may exhibit indicators of “dry drowning” or secondary drowning after they are out of the water.&nbsp;Secondary drowning occurs when inhaled water causes an accumulation of fluid within the lungs, known as pulmonary edema. This disorder may be lethal if not addressed promptly.</p><h2>How was Jago’s secondary drowning diagnosed?</h2><p>While the doctor’s original diagnosis was food poisoning, when Simpson informed him his kid was coughing in the pool that morning, he encouraged the parents to take him to the hospital. Simpson remembered:</p><p>“Jago’s health worsened throughout the hour-long drive to the hospital, and he seemed to be drifting in and out of consciousness. He was hurried through for CT scans and X-rays, and we were informed, to our horror, that he had water in his lungs and was minutes away from pneumonia.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Charlie-Simpson-2.jpg alt="Charlie Simpson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Jago was diagnosed with secondary drowning at the time and spent three days in the hospital. Simpson also said that “the result may have been extremely different” if they had not hurried him to the hospital as soon as possible.</p><h2>Symptoms and precautions for secondary drowning</h2><p>Charlie Simpson also said in his Instagram post that, although secondary drowning is uncommon, it is seldom acknowledged, making it even more difficult to identify right away. He further claimed that drowning requires “less than half a glass of water,” with symptoms developing up to 72 hours after the occurrence.&nbsp;While the symptoms are not very concerning at first, they may become serious if not treated promptly. Coughing, chest discomfort, breathing difficulties, and fatigue are among the symptoms, according to Web MD. There may also be indicators of irritation or a significant decrease in energy levels.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Charlie-Simpson-3.jpg alt="Charlie Simpson" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to Web MD, if a person exhibits any of the following symptoms after exiting the water, they should be evaluated. Concerned family members must likewise monitor the patient and record symptoms for the following 24 hours.&nbsp;If the symptoms increase, the patient should have a chest X-ray and an IV placed. They may need to use a breathing tube if they have significant respiratory problems, which is typical in secondary drowning.</p><h2>Additional updates</h2><p>Charlie Simson also discussed his son’s symptoms, which included “vomiting, fever, labored breathing, and lethargy.” However, accompanying the message, he shared a photo of Jago and assured supporters that he was under “great care” at the hospital.&nbsp;The artist sought to raise awareness about the issue via his message.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiaoZmiobamedKipKmrn6N6s63IrJydZZGsrrOxzZ6qrGWRl7y2wIysnJynnpmus8WMnamor56eu6h5wJ%2Brnqpdnba0edKopWarpZuzpr7EnWSfqp%2BieqrAjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
