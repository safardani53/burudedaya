Trays filled with nutritional chocolate shakes from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Usana</a> were also passed around to the pint-sized crowd, while the adults sipped on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>La Croix</a>‘s lemon, lime and passion fruit sparkling water.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before heading home with treat bags filled with goodies from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Mabel’s Labels</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Little Green</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Soothie Suckers</a>, everyone indulged in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>Polkatots</a>‘s dessert bar, made up of caramel apples, one-shaped cookies and a vanilla and chocolate frog cupcake cake.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Fosters returns June 8 at 8 p.m. on ABC Family.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-low-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>DustyLu Photography</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After the party, Saum caught up with PEOPLE to discuss everything from her favorite memory of the day and the twins’ personalities to their sleep schedules and how her marriage has changed since becoming a mother.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>PEOPLE: What was your favorite thing about the party? Any sweet/memorable moments with the boys?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sherri:</strong> The party was dynamite. I used to think we’d be the anti big celebration parents. “Here’s a birthday paper bag, you guys, now go play in the yard.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But I was totally enchanted with what the Good Carma girls created for the boys. A frog fantasy inspired by their favorite Spanish TV show Atencion Atencion. I loved everything, but I think my favorite was the smash cakes and genius treats from Polkatots. The boys looked so confused as to why we were allowing this mayhem. But, they finally got into it and made the most beautiful mess.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>DustyLu Photography</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>PEOPLE: When they were born, you said John was quieter and Michael was your man-baby. Are their personalities still completely opposite?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sherri:</strong> I’d say John is still the more chill of the two; he’s really focused and very independent. Michael likes action and interaction, and he’s super rambunctious.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>PEOPLE: Now that they’re mobile, how have things changed? Is Kamar still the baby whisperer when it comes to settling them down?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sherri:</strong> Now that they are crawling and nearly walking, we are constantly yanking them out of the empty fireplace or chasing them up and down the stairs. It feels like an Olympic sport!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kamar is a performer and really puts on a show for them. He dances and sings and can turn tantrums into laughter.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>DustyLu Photography</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>PEOPLE: Are they sleeping through the night yet?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sherri:</strong> They’ve been sleeping like kings since about 5 months, which means now we can, too. It makes all the difference in the world when everyone is rested.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although I confess to having a confusing impulse to wake them and play some more. No matter how tired I may be, I miss them as soon as they go to sleep.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-low-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>DustyLu Photography</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>PEOPLE: You mentioned that you had found your groove with breastfeeding. Are you still nursing?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sherri:</strong> I’m no longer breastfeeding and I miss that as well. Even though working and nursing was a little nutty, that connection and bonding was one of my favorite things.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>DustyLu Photography</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>PEOPLE: What has been the hardest part of motherhood during the first year?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sherri:</strong> I’d say the hardest part during the first year was Kamar and I melding our parenting styles and instincts — I’m super laid back and he functions best with planning and schedules.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But as stubborn as I am in my freewheeling ways, I have to admit that having structure was crucial to making this machine run well.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>DustyLu Photography</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>PEOPLE: How has it been balancing both babies with your role on The Fosters? Do you bring the babies to the set?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sherri:</strong> For me, the only way to manage the shooting schedule with The Fosters and having newborns was to have them come to set as often as possible. Some days it could only be 30 minutes, but it calmed me and made me so happy to be able to at least squish them and kiss them as much as I could.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-low-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>DustyLu Photography</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>PEOPLE: What’s one thing you would tell another expectant mom?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sherri:</strong> I would tell another expectant mom that sometimes Googling your pregnancy and baby questions can be helpful — but don’t overdo it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There’s so much contradictory advice and information it can be overwhelming. Trust that you will figure things out in your own time and that it really does get easier and more fun every day.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-low-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>DustyLu Photography</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>PEOPLE: Do you think your family is complete or will John and Michael eventually become big brothers?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sherri:</strong> I’d like to think we have an addition on the family radar, but I’m so grateful and in love with our two boys so I don’t want to get greedy!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>PEOPLE: Their hair is gorgeous! Have they had their first hair cut yet?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sherri:</strong> I can’t cut their hair, I can’t! Don’t make me! And other moms out there, don’t judge me when we cruise by with their hair in man buns until they’re 25.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>DustyLu Photography</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-91 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>PEOPLE: How has your marriage changed since welcoming the twins?</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-93 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sherri:</strong> Kamar and I definitely have to carve out our “we” time and keep it sacred — it could be very easy to be baby-consumed and put ourselves down the priority list. But it’s nice putting extra thought into what we will do. It feels very date-like and special.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-95 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-96 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>DustyLu Photography</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-98 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>PEOPLE: What do John and Michael think of their big brother, Caylen?

When they were first born, he wrote them the sweetest letter that we had framed, telling them they can always count on him.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-102 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He’s the kindest, warmest young man and he’s going to be an amazing influence on them in years to come.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-104 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-low-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-105 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><br>DustyLu Photography</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-107 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">— Anya Leon</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CWv6a606xmrKCVp7%2BqedKarKZlpKy2r7%2BMn6Crq6Rir6q%2B06GbmrFdpbWwwM6sZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
