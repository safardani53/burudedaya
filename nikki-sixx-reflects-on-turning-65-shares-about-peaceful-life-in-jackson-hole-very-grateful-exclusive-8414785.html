"We spend a lot of time outside. I mean, the whole point of being here is to really be outside whether you're into skiing or fishing or hiking or being up on the lakes or snowmobiling."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"And it's very social here, so it's fantastic for us," the Mötley Crüe bass player shares of the friendly, like-minded town. "I wake up and I'm like, 'I can't think of a place I'd rather be.' And to be able to still be creative at 65 and have a wonderful family and be surrounded by good friends. I'm very grateful."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for the first person who wished him a happy birthday on his special day? "Ruby," the dad of five says fondly. Sixx has four older children Gunner, 32, Storm, 29, Decker, 28, and Frankie, 22, who all individually serve as an "inspiration" to him in his ventures, he says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Throughout the day of "chilling" and picking out a Christmas tree on Monday ahead of his low-key dinner with friends, Sixx also expressed how happy he was to receive "beautiful text messages" and emails from people he's known for "years and years."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's just a great opportunity to reach out and let people know how you feel. So I'm feeling very loved today, very happy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"No gifts, all gab!" Courtney chimes in of celebrating more simply this year.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sixx adds, "And a big initiative for me has been over the years and moving forward is the charitable side of things and giving back."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Along with raising funds for charities like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Covenant House</a>, the artist and photographer has been branching further into the film community, as he and Courtney serve as board members of the Jackson Hole International Film Festival.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We love the idea of bringing arts and culture to Jackson," Sixx says. "We've been talking about this for the last year and a half or so, it’s been in motion. There's a lot of really fantastic people involved."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The inaugural JHIFF festival was also launched by board chair Stuart Suna, who is the founder and former owner of N.Y.C.'s famed Silvercup Studios. Suna is also chair emeritus of the Hamptons International Film Festival, which has been going strong for over 30 years, which is what Sixx, Suna, executive director Marni Walsh, and the rest of the organization intend for JHIFF.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's the first of many years.
