While the singer gravitated towards romantic ball gowns and feminine silhouettes for her early red carpet moments, she's stepped out of the box more recently with tailored suits and menswear-inspired looks. And just like with her music, Swift is bound to continue to surprise us with her style, whether she's attending an awards show or strolling around Tribeca.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading for a look back at some of <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Taylor Swift</a>'s best fashion moments.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text><strong>Taylor Swift at the CMAs in 2006</strong></span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Rick Diamond/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Shortly after releasing her very first single, "Tim McGraw," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Swift made her CMAs debut</a> in a black, floor-length Elvira gown with black opera gloves.

The brilliant gold gown featured a beaded bodice and satin skirt, and the star's blonde curls were pulled back and swept over one shoulder.

She didn't take home any awards that night (she was nominated for Best New Artist, which <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Adele</a> won), but the appearance was certainly a memorable start to her journey as a style icon.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text><strong>Taylor Swift at the CMAs in 2008</strong></span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jemal Countess/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She was still firmly in her country music era, but Swift looked like a pop princess in this sequin gown by Kaufman Franco at the 2008 CMAs.

From the front, the star's dress choice might have seemed simple, but the low back and sheer side panels gave it a sexy edge.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text><strong>Taylor Swift at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards in 2013</strong></span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Christopher Polk/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Taking the Grecian look for a spin, Swift appeared on the 2013 Grammys red carpet in a cream J.

She left her neck bare and instead accessorized with chunky rings and gemstone earrings.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text><strong>Taylor Swift at the Met Gala in 201</strong>4</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Swift's pale pink Oscar de la Renta gown was so beautiful that even her cats couldn't resist it. "I've never seen more fashionable people lose their composure quicker than when a cat walks up to a satin, custom Oscar de la Renta gown and then decides to make a home inside of it," the singer told PEOPLE of her pet's Met Gala antics in 2014.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She just passed, dug her claws in and started to roll … like when you see a crocodile attack an antelope on National Geographic," she continued.

According to a rep for the brand, the dress was an archived piece that was never produced. The star's gold accessories — including a choker necklace and clutch purse — gave the look an ultra-glamorous feel.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text><strong>Taylor Swift at the 58th Annual Grammy Awards in 2016</strong></span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With the help of her striking new bob haircut, Swift stunned at the 2016 Grammys Awards in a brightly colored two-piece ensemble.
