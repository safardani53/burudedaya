On the Monday, December 19, episode of<i> <a href=#>Vanderpump Rules</a></i>, <b>Scheana Shay</b> and <b>Kristen Doute</b> threw a surprise shindig for <b>Mike Shay</b> and<b> Brian Carter</b>. At the poolside bash, <b>Stassi Schroeder</b> decided to confront Scheana about her supposed loyalty to <b>Lala Kent</b> — and the drama erupted. Surprise!</p><p><b>Jax Gets Straight Up With Stassi</b></p><p>Stassi might not work at Sur anymore, but she has proven to be the restaurant’s most loyal customer. “I am ride or f‑‑king die with those goat cheese balls,” Stassi declared. “And my white wine!”</p><p>The ex-employee decided to head into Sur one afternoon for a quick lunch. She tracked down <b>Brittany Cartwright </b>and asked her if she could interview her boyfriend, <b>Jax Taylor</b>, for an episode of her podcast, <i>Straight Up With Stassi</i>. Stassi wanted Jax to reveal all his sneaky, “piece of s‑‑t boyfriend” ways.</p><p>“I figured it would be a really good idea to have Jax, now that he’s reformed, answer, ‘How do you get away with cheating?’” she explained to Brittany.</p><p>Brittany admitted that she didn’t like to dwell on Jax’s past behavior, but she told Stassi that she didn’t have a problem with Jax participating in her podcast.</p><p>“I’m actually fine with Jax doing this podcast because the only thing Stassi’s horrible ex-boyfriend and the man I know and love have in common is that his name is Jax Taylor,” Brittany insisted.</p><p>Brittany mentioned the podcast to <a href=#><b>Lisa Vanderpump</b></a>, who responded with a dramatic eye roll. “What has she got to say that she hasn’t said already?” Lisa retorted.</p><p>Jax met up with Stassi to tape the podcast a few days later. He happily answered Stassi’s questions about cheating and even agreed to takes a sociopath quiz on-air. Naturally, the test confirmed Jax is a full-blown psycho — but Stassi determined it wasn’t the worst thing in the world.</p><p>“Jax shouldn’t feel bad about being a sociopath,” Stassi reasoned. “I’m an alcoholic, so he’s in good company.”</p><p><b>A Failed Therapy Session</b></p><p>With the rambunctious James Kennedy out of the picture, Lisa finally noticed the drama going on between Scheana, Lala and Katie Maloney. Worried that the tension would start to have a negative effect on the restaurant’s atmosphere, Lisa asked Ariana Madix to get the ladies together and work out their differences.</p><p>But <a href=#>the “makeup session” failed miserably</a>. Lala tried to own up to her body-shaming remarks, but Katie didn’t want to hear it. Lala insisted she could only apologize so many times. “Do I need to, like, [pleasure] you to make you forget?” Lala cried out.</p><p>In an effort to keep the peace, Scheana timidly apologized to Lala for possibly spreading untrue rumors about her. But Katie became irate that Scheana didn’t stand up to Lala. Indeed, Katie told Stassi that Scheana actually offered an apology to Lala, and Stassi lost it.</p><p>“Scheana apologizing to Lala is like one of the victims apologizing to Charles Manson,” Stassi gasped.</p><p>Around midnight, Katie sent Scheana a number of mean text messages claiming that Scheana blatantly disregarded her feelings when she apologized to Lala. Scheana went over to Brittany and Jax’s apartment the next morning to tell them about the phone-message attack.</p><p>Brittany and Jax tried to figure out Katie’s motivation behind the texts. “Stassi Schroeder and probably some tequila,” Scheana offered.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><b>Sur-prise!</b></p><p>The day of the surprise party finally arrived. Well, semi-surprise party: Kristen told Carter that the surprise party was for Shay, and Scheana told Shay that the surprise party was for Carter. Both men knew they were headed to a surprise party — they just didn’t know it was for themselves.</p><p>“This party isn’t exactly a surprise party,”<b> Tom Sandoval</b> laughed. “I mean, both guys knew they were going to a surprise party. It’s not a surprise.”</p><p>Kristen, Stassi and Katie spent most of the party huddled together at the poolside bar, avoiding Scheana. Kristen and Scheana finally found a moment to step inside the house and chat, but the conversation was unproductive and left Scheana in tears. Scheana rejoined the party — only for Stassi to grab her and pull her aside.</p><p>Stassi attempted to have an alcohol-fueled “talk” with Scheana, but she didn’t seem too interested in hearing Scheana’s side of the story. Scheana asked Ariana to intervene and confirm how mild Scheana’s apology to Lala actually was, but Stassi became emotional and ran away to cry in the bathroom. Katie found Stassi sobbing on the bathroom floor and called out Scheana for being a bad friend. Katie insisted that she could read someone as “transparent” as Scheana like a book.</p><p>But Scheana held her ground. “Over the past few years, I’ve fought with my friends and made up with them,” Scheana told the cameras. “I’ve never thought I was better than them until this moment.”</p><p>Tell <i>Us: </i>Do you side with Scheana or Stassi and Katie?</p><p><i>Vanderpump Rules </i>airs on Bravo Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaK2appSav7HBzKlkq62cmsBuv9OaqqyhXai8o7%2BMmp2tnaJis6qzx61ksKGknXq0r8eemKeZXayBdoKPbWho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
