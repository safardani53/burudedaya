to have some of the best fish in the world swimming around our coast.</p><p>“Curiously though we don’t eat a lot of it, it all gets exported to the EU – or used to.</p><p>“Now with Brexit, we all need to eat more gloriously healthy fish to look after our fishermen.</p><p>“So come on everyone, eat more fish!”</p><p>Here, Rick shares some of his best British fish recipes.</p><h3 class=has-text-align-center>Goujons of Cornish sole with Parmesan breadcrumbs</h3><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>(Serves 4 as a first course)</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000642080824.jpg><p><strong>YOU NEED:</strong></p><ul><li>500g skinned lemon sole fillets</li><li>100g fresh white breadcrumbs or Japanese panko breadcrumbs</li><li>25g Parmesan cheese, finely grated</li><li>½ tsp cayenne pepper</li><li>Sunflower oil, for deep-frying</li><li>50g plain flour</li><li>3 eggs, beaten</li><li>Salt</li><li>Lemon wedges, to serve</li></ul><p><strong>METHOD:</strong> Lightly season each lemon sole fillet with salt and cut diagonally across into strips about the thickness of your little finger.</p><p>Mix the breadcrumbs with the grated Parmesan cheese and cayenne pepper.</p><p>Heat some oil for deep-frying to 190C and line a baking tray with plenty of kitchen paper.</p><p>Coat the goujons a few at a time in the flour, then in the beaten egg and finally in the breadcrumb mixture, making sure they take on an even coating and remain separate.</p><p>Drop a handful into the oil and deep-fry for about one minute until crisp and golden.</p><p>Lift out with a slotted spoon on to the paper-lined tray to drain and repeat with the remainder, making sure the oil has come back to temperature first.</p><p>Serve with lemon wedges.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Where to buy affordable British fish</h3></p><p>RICK SAYS: “Let’s face it, the most common place you are likely to buy fish is your supermarket.</p><p>“If you are lucky enough to have a fishmonger nearby it’s by far and away the best place to buy fish, but I’ve written all these recipes with supermarket fish in mind.</p><p>“I take delight in buying supermarket fish, just to see what’s available and, more often than not, it’s good.”</p><h3 class=has-text-align-center>Crab with pasta, parsley and chilli</h3><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>(Serves 4)</strong></p><img

chopped</li></ul><p><strong>METHOD:</strong> Boil the pasta in plenty of well-salted water until tender but still firm with some bite to it.</p><p>The best way to cook pasta until it is al dente is to

let it boil or you will alter the flavours.</p><p>Place the pasta on four warmed plates and spoon over the sauce.</p><h3 class=has-text-align-center>Grilled hake on spring mash with soy butter</h3><p

value for money and they are widely available.</p><p>“The simplest way to cook them is to steam them in a pan with the lid on with a splash of white wine and stir in some butter, parsley and maybe a touch of garlic.”</p><p><strong>CORNISH HAKE</strong></p><p>“I buy this vacuum packed from my local Tesco and find it very good quality and a deliciously meaty fish.”</p><p><strong>SEABASS</strong></p><p>“It’s unlikely that you will come across wild sea bass, but farmed fish is really good.</p><p>“Conveniently, one fish is about right for a single serving.</p><p>“Of similar quality is sea bream, also delicious.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>CORNISH SARDINES</strong></p><p>“Sardines are unbelievable value for money and are caught daily during the season – August to February. They are best grilled or barbecued.</p><p>“They used to be known as pilchards, but the market was transformed by re-naming them Cornish sardines.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>BRITISH BROWN CRAB</strong></p><p>“This is the best- tasting crab in the world.</p><p>“Crab is still really good value for money. It’s tastiest if you buy your own and pick it yourself but I appreciate it’s a bit of a task for most of us.</p><p>“Crab meat is still a great buy – look out for the back shells of white and brown meat, called dressed crab, in your supermarket.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SQUID</strong></p><p>“This is really one for your fishmonger. Occasionally it can be good in supermarkets, but it’s a bit hit and miss.</p><p>“Squid doesn’t need to be battered or breadcrumbed but doing either is also delicious – and makes a few squid rings go a long way.”</p><p>“It is best simply stir fried in garlic and ginger with a bit of chilli to give it a South East Asian flavour or more gently pan fried with olive oil and garlic for a Mediterranean flavour.</p><h3 class=has-text-align-center>Grilled scallops with toasted hazelnut and coriander butter</h3><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>(Serves 4)</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000642080815.jpg><p><strong>YOU NEED:</strong></p><ul><li>16 prepared scallops in the shell</li><li>25g unsalted butter, melted</li><li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li></ul><p><strong>For the toasted hazelnut and coriander butter:</strong></p><ul><li>20g unblanched hazelnuts</li><li>75g unsalted butter, softened</li><li>7g coriander leaves</li><li>2 tbsp flat-leaf parsley leaves</li><li>7g shallots, roughly chopped</li><li>1 tsp fresh lemon juice</li></ul><p><strong>METHOD:</strong> Spread the hazelnuts over a baking tray and toast under the grill for 4-5 minutes, shaking the tray now and then, until they are golden brown.</p><p>Tip them into a clean tea towel and rub off the skins.</p><p>Leave to cool, then chop them roughly and tip them into a food processor.</p><p>Add the softened butter with the coriander, parsley, shallots, lemon juice, a good pinch of salt and some pepper and blend together until well mixed.</p><p>Pre-heat the grill to high.</p><p>Place the scallop shells on a large baking tray (or do them in batches if necessary).</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Fabulous</h2></p><p>Brush the scallops with the melted butter and season with a little salt and pepper, then grill for 1½ minutes.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>Drop a generous teaspoonful of the hazelnut and coriander butter on to each scallop and return to the grill for 1½ minutes, until cooked through.</p><p>Serve immediately.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Judge Jules reveals surprise link to Rick Stein on Celebrity MasterChef</span><p><strong>GOT a story?
