Subsequent images featured Pete and his sister, <a href=#><strong>Casey Davidson</strong></a>, with <a href=#>their late father</a>. Amy also included a photo of black work boots while holding Scott’s photo above them.</p><p>Amy’s Instagram post comes one day after Pete took the stage alongside <a href=#><strong>John Mulaney</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jon Stewart</strong></a> in Atlantic City for their <a href=#>“Jon, John & Pete” tour</a>. During the Sunday, September 10 show, Pete noted he had <a href=#>that “post-rehab glow,”</a> making light of his recent stint in treatment.</p><p>In June, multiple outlets reported that he had <a href=#>entered a rehab facility</a> after struggling with PTSD and borderline personality disorder.</p><p>While Pete did not make any reference to his late father on stage this weekend, the former <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> star, 29, has spoken candidly about his father’s death over the years. Most recently, Pete revealed the moment he found out his father had died.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Pete-Davidson-s-Mom-Amy-Will-Always-Be-Grateful-for-Late-Husband-in-911-Tribute-287.jpg><p>“My dad told me he was going to pick me up from school on 9/11. I got picked up by my mom. She didn’t tell me what was going on for like three days,” Pete recalled on an episode of the <a href=#>“Real Ones With Jon Bernthal”</a> podcast in March. “She kept telling me, ‘Dad’s at work,’ ‘He’s coming home,’ whatever. I had no idea.”</p><p>Pete’s mom “grounded” him and barred him from watching TV at the time. It wasn’t too long before Pete inevitably heard about the World Trade Center attack.</p><p>“Then one night, I turned on the TV and I just saw my dad on the TV,” he remembered. “I was like, ‘Oh, OK.’ And they were like, these <a href=#>are all the firemen that are, like, dead</a>.”</p><p>Pete said the entire experience was “weird” because his family didn’t know that Scott had died “for, like, three weeks” before it was confirmed.</p><p>“They were finding people, you know? They were pulling people out of s–t, and there was just some sort of hope,” he shared. “Like, it was just up and down and nobody knew how to deal with it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Pete-Davidson-s-Mom-Amy-Will-Always-Be-Grateful-for-Late-Husband-in-911-Tribute-286.jpg><p>The stand-up comedian admitted to having some form of abandonment issues because of his past.</p><p>“You know, Dad says he’s coming to pick you up and he doesn’t,” Pete said. “For life, I’m like, I don’t believe anyone, and I’m trying to learn how to believe people — and Hollywood isn’t exactly the greatest place to learn that skill.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapnaSaeqWt1aKbrKeeqHquu8xmmKaxXai1or7ErGRyZWFmerW%2ByJusrZ1dqbxuuMCtnGagpaivorrDZqqcp6SpfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
