He died a few years ago, he got knocked over and I buried him in the back garden.</p><p>But Dave later dug up his former furry friend, saying he found the cat's bones scattered everywhere - so he unearthed only the skull.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in UK News</h2></p><p>Dave also owns other stuffed animals he has created and a mummified cat which was found under the floorboards of a Tudor house.</p><p>What's more, he even has a mole, puppy and a dog’s testicles - preserved for years by injecting chemicals into the wet specimens and placing them in jars of alcohol.</p><p>Dave revealed: “It’s a bit more Doctor Frankenstein, but some people who come here are really drawn to it and actually prefer it to the taxidermy."</p><p>He started taxidermy workshops after perfecting the technique ever since his partner bought him a class for Christmas ten years ago.</p><p>His taxidermy classes are - surprisingly - most popular with middle-aged women who now flock to the morbitorium in their droves.</p><p>Dave explained: “They have told me how they’ve really gone for it with their interest in horror since they’ve got older and maybe have more time on their hands."</p><p>He told Wales Online his favourites are one of his mummified cats and Chester, his dodo-peacock hybrid which sits on a cabinet near the front door and greets visitors.</p><p>Dave is raking in the cash from his new business venture.</p><p>He divulged: “It’s paying all my bills and the mortgage. It was my five-year plan to get out of IT and do the Morbitorium full time but then lockdown happened and that accelerated everything."</p><p>Dave said it hasn't all been smooth sailing, but he has managed to make it work.</p><p>That's not all, though.</p><p>Dave regularly invites a priestess from a coven to perform tarot card reading workshops at the house, bringing in visitors and tarot fans.</p><p>He also has a dozen ouija boards which cover a whole wall - most of which were donated to him by people hoping he’d take them off their hands.</p><p>A sign on the wall reads: "Morbitorium accepts no responsibility for any experiences or attachments you may encounter as a result of contact with these donated boards."</p><p>Most of the boards have been sent with letters explaining scary experiences their previous owners have had.</p><p>But what does Dave's family think of his weird hobby?</p><p>They're surprisingly okay with it.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Dave said: “My partner is all right with it, she’s quite alternative too. She wouldn’t collect it herself but because I’ve got it she’s into it. When my kids were younger they weren’t sure but because they’ve grown up with it they love it now.”</p><p>The locals are fans too, with many venture into the house to test out the ouija boards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/taxidermist-horror-lover-south-wales-800582777.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/taxidermist-horror-lover-south-wales-800582713.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/taxidermist-horror-lover-south-wales-800582733.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfqrivsdasZmtpZmZ9doCRaKykZaeatrOwjKGmrquVYsGixMidnKulqWK6trnMop2inZRisKLAjJ2moGWkmsC1tcKlnKxlpp7AqsCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
