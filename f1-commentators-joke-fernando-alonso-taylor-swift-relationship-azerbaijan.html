Nothing serious tho since they are both recently single."</p><p>However, the account listed the post in a section titled "for entertainment purposes only" and included a disclaimer that highlighted "some of the emails posted are complete BS".</p><p>Alonso, who was made aware of the rumours when they began circulating, has since been very active on social media.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on F1">Read More on F1</h2><p>He has continued to tease the potential romance with <a href=#>cryptic posts and videos</a> on his TikTok and Instagram.</p><p>Earlier this week, he uploaded a cheeky clip to his TikTok whereby he scrolled through social media before winking at the camera, all while the song "Karma" by Swift played in the background.</p><p>He also commented "Feeling 33" on the video, which is thought to be a reference to the singer's song "22".</p><p>And now several F1 commentators have jumped on the bandwagon by referencing Swift songs when talking about Alonso.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Motorsport</h2></p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# aria-label="FREE BETS AND SIGN UP DEALS - BEST NEW CUSTOMER OFFERS (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">FREE BETS AND SIGN UP DEALS - BEST NEW CUSTOMER OFFERS</a></strong></p><p>Sky Sports' Karun Chandhok was quick to reference the song "Blank Space" during qualifying on Friday.</p><p>He said: "Fernando Alonso's found a bit of blank space ahead of him!"</p><p>Rachel Brookes, also of Sky Sports, said: "Fernando, it's been an interesting few weeks for you during this break, I knew you were trouble!", in reference to Swift's hit song "I knew you were trouble".</p><p>When quizzing Alonso about his relationship status on Saturday, F1 reporter Will Buxton said: "I have to ask this one because if I don't I'll just be leaving a 'Blank Space' and I know it is potentially your 'Love Story' and nobody else's, but there have been rumours over the break!"</p><p>To which the Spaniard jokingly replied: "It's so complicated [the] Baku format already! I'm sure you have a lot of questions!"</p><p>And legendary Sky Sports presenter David Croft was eager to squeeze as many references into his commentary as possible.</p><p>Throughout practice and qualifying, the 52-year-old referenced a number of Swift's huge hits, including: "Getaway Car", "Bad Blood", "Don't Blame Me", "Style", "Would've Could've Should've" and "Mastermind".</p><p>Despite his repeated hinting at a potential relationship, Alonso has <a href=#>refused to officially confirm</a> if he is dating Swift.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>He told Spanish outlet <a href=# aria-label="Marca (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marca</a>: "I usually keep my personal and professional life apart.
