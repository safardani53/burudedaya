It has just this flawless aesthetic that I always strive to,” Quinn, 34, told <a href=#>Allure</a> magazine in an interview published on Wednesday, November 2.</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The real estate agent, who starred on the first five seasons of the Netflix hit <a href=#>before exiting the series in August</a>, revealed that while looking like the Mattel doll is her first priority, it isn’t always an easy feat — especially when it comes to her golden locks.</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“I have such a love-hate relationship with my blonde hair. <a href=#>I’ve been bleaching my hair for years</a>, since I was probably 14 or 15,” she explained. “I’m already naturally light, probably like a shade three. But I’ve been dying my hair forever. And with that comes damage.”</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>When it comes to ageing, however, the reality star said she is “thankful” there are procedures available to slow the process. “Unfortunately, I can’t do anything about [getting older], <a href=#>but thank God for Botox and fillers</a>,”&nbsp;she gushed.</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The pressure to look “flawless” while living in the spotlight is relatively new to Quinn, who told Allure on Thursday that she “didn’t have social media” when Selling Sunset premiered in 2019. She gained notoriety, however, when she was regularly thrown in the middle of drama with her costars.</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“I feel like I was the only one that understood the assignment,” Quinn told the <a href=#>New York Times</a> in July. “I was the only one that said, ‘Hey, <a href=#>this is a show, and I’m going to give the world</a> a show.’”</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The Texas native also claimed that Selling Sunset is “avidly scripted” despite being promoted as a reality series. “No doubt about that,” she quipped.</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Viewers first questioned if the How to Be a Boss B*tch author was exiting the show after costar <a href=#><strong>Emma Hernan</strong></a> accused her of bribing her clients during a season 5 episode in April.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Quinn, for her part, shut down the allegations via social media, writing via Twitter, “30 minutes til the launch of #SellingSunset enjoy the new season and all of its 5,000 fake storylines.”</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>The businesswoman, however, did not participate in the season 5 reunion that was taped that same month, citing illness as the reasoning behind her absence.</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Christine tested positive for COVID and out of an abundance of caution for the cast and crew, she did not attend the reunion,” a rep for Quinn told Us Weekly at the time. “Producers offered her the opportunity to video chat, but she declined because she wasn’t feeling well enough to do it.”</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>While Quinn ultimately <a href=#>revealed that it was her decision to leave the series</a> — and subsequently The Oppenheim Group — she exclusively shared with Us in May that she wasn’t expecting to be portrayed in such a negative light when she signed up for the series.</span><span class="x_x_Apple-converted-space x_x_ContentPasted0 x_ContentPasted0">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="x_x_p3 x_x_ContentPasted0"><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“Bless their hearts for trying [to make the bribery story line a big deal],” she said. “But no, that absolutely did not happen. … I watched the show and I was shocked.
