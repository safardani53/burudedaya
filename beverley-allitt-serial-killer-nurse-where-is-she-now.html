The Sun</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><strong>BEVERLEY ALLITT is a former nurse who murdered four babies in her care in 1991.</strong></p><p>The killer worked at Grantham Hospital in <a href=#>Lincolnshire</a> and was caught after medical staff raised the alarm over the deaths.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000000878018-e1539706241114.jpg><h2>Who is Beverley Allitt?</h2><p>Beverley Allitt is a convicted baby killer who has been nicknamed the Angel of Death.</p><p>She left school in 1987, aged 18, and began her nurse training at Grantham College with with just a handful of qualifications.</p><p>Medical records from 1985 show Allitt to be a psychologically disturbed individual who was prone to self-harm.</p><p>She was the only student nurse from her course who failed to get a job, and was often absent from her studies due to illness.</p><p>Allitt was offered a six-month contract at Grantham & Kesteven Hospital despite being under-qualified.</p><p>She began her role in December 1990 due to severe staff shortages on Ward Four, where children were cared for.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>In 1991, at the age of 22, Allitt <a href=#>went on a deadly killing spree</a> on the children's ward.</p><p>She committed the murders either by insulin or potassium overdose, or injecting an air bubble into the bloodstream, which can cause lung collapse.</p><p><a href=#>Police</a> and medical staff were initially unable to establish how the <a href=#>crimes</a> were carried out.</p><p>Doctors have since shared their belief that Allitt suffered from the psychological disorder Münchausen syndrome or <a href=#>Münchausen syndrome</a> by proxy.</p><p>The syndrome involves inflicting or faking physical or psychological symptoms for attention, while Münchausen syndrome by proxy – an escalation of the syndrome – involves harming others to create attention.</p><h2>Who were her victims?</h2><h3>Liam Taylor</h3><p>Allitt’s first victim was seven week old Liam Taylor, who was admitted with a chest infection.</p><p>He began to improve after being given antibiotics but, after his parents were sent home to rest, he mysteriously took a turn for the worse.</p><p>Doctors were only alerted to his worsening condition by Allitt, despite the baby being hooked up to alarms to monitor his breathing and oxygen levels.</p><p>He was put on life support but died of a heart attack in his mum's arms the next day.</p><p>Consultants on the ward were confused by Liam's dramatic relapse and questioned why the alarms didn't sound in time.</p><h3>Timothy Hardwick</h3><p>Timothy Hardwick, 11, had cerebral palsy and was admitted to the ward after suffering an epileptic seizure.</p><p>He fell asleep, with his breathing and heart rate stable, but just 30 minutes later Allitt raised the alarm that he was dying.</p><p>Attempts to re-start his heart were made but he died on March 5, 1991.</p><h3>Becky & Katie Phillips</h3><p>Becky Phillips, two months old, was admitted to the ward for gastroenteritis on April 1, 1991.</p><p>She was given an insulin overdose by Allitt and died at home two days later.</p><p>Doctors were concerned that whatever had caused Becky’s death could also affect her identical twin Katie, so she was admitted to hospital for monitoring.</p><p>This genuine concern actually put Katie in harm's way and in direct contact with Allitt.</p><p>Within hours, the nurse attempted to kill Katie four times by suffocation and injections of insulin and potassium.</p><p>Katie was put on life support, suffered epileptic fits and was eventually transferred to Queen’s Medical Centre, away from the nurse who had attempted to kill her.</p><p>She was left epileptic and paralysed as a result of Allitt's actions.</p><h3>Claire Peck</h3><p>Claire Peck, 15 months, was admitted to the ward after suffering an asthma attack on April 22, 1991.</p><p>After being put on a ventilator, she was left in Allitt's care and then went into cardiac arrest.</p><p>She was resuscitated but died after a second episode of cardiac arrest - during an interval when she was left alone with Allitt again.</p><p>The toddler became the fourth child to die on the ward in two months.</p><h3>Kayley Desmond</h3><p>Kayley almost died when Allitt injected her with air at the Grantham and Kesteven Hospital, Lincs, in 1991.</p><p>She was resuscitated after being injected with an air bubble that caused her lungs to collapse and triggered two cardiac arrests.</p><p><a href=#>Her mum Sharon said in 2018</a>: "You take a child to hospital and you think they are in the best place. This cannot be put in jeopardy. The families of Allitt's victims can never get over what she did.</p><p>She also revealed that Kayley, who was left with severe learning difficulties after the attack, was <a href=#>on anti-depressant</a>s to treat anxiety as she fears Allitt will come back to get her.</p><p>Five other children, aged between two months and five years old, survived twisted Allitt's attacks.</p><h2>Where is Beverley Allitt now?</h2><p>Beverley Allitt has been serving her <a href=#>prison</a> sentence at <a href=#>Rampton Secure Hospital</a> since 1993.</p><p>She was found guilty on May 28, 1993, and given 13 life sentences, with a minimum of 30 years.</p><p>Allitt was convicted of four counts of murder, three att­em­pted murders and six counts of GBH.</p><p>She has since admitted, in writing, to all 13 crimes that she was convicted for, though she pleaded not guilty at trial.</p><p>Allitt was caught after medical staff raised the alarm when the number of cardiac arrests on the children's ward raised suspicions.</p><p>Police were finally called on April 30, 1991, and detectives examining the nursing time sheets for all the deaths and events found that one name appeared every time: Beverley Allitt.</p><p>Allitt was suspended from duties immediately as investigators began to examine each individual case.</p><p>The one that stood out to them was Paul Crampton.</p><p>The pathology report revealed that Paul had 43,147 milliunits of insulin in his blood – one of the highest levels ever found in a human.</p><p>Police believed that Allitt had injected a whole adult syringe of insulin into his body.</p><p>Pages from the ward allocation log at the time of Paul's admission had been ripped out, and were later found at Allitt's house during a search.</p><p>Investigators concluded that syringes full of insulin or potassium chloride were Allitt's favoured murder weapons – the drugs either inducing lethal hypoglycaemia or cardiac arrest in the victims.</p><p>A 2019 documentary revealed <a href=#>how Allitt laughed when charged</a> with the four murders.</p><p>In November 2021 Allett became eligible for parole but, as of August 2023, she remains locked up.</p><p>Kayley, who survived an attack by Allit, has r<a href=#>evealed her fears that Allitt could "get her"</a> if released.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfbIJxhJFrb2ialauys7jEsmSapJyewbV50p6popmcYriquMueqWampafApnnWoZyrnV2ewG6%2Fx55kp6enZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
