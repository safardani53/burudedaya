But it isn't just her talent and knowledge of football that keeps the fans glued to their TV screen. Her&nbsp;beauty&nbsp;and charm, equally, have managed to win the hearts of many football fans.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Maintaining the secrecy of her private life, she doesn’t talk&nbsp;about it at all, but this seems to have worked in her favor as in the mind of male viewers, “she is single and ready to mingle.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>So is the&nbsp;41-year-old NFL expert really single? Or is she just good at hiding her love life from the eyes of her fan followers? <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Frelund Never Speaks about the Man in Her Life</h2><p>Ever since Frelund debuted&nbsp;as a Predictive Analytics Expert in the NFL Network in 2016, football fans seemed to have fallen in love with her beauty and confidence.</p><p>As football has&nbsp;more concentrated male <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">followers</a>, the reporter, evidently, has become the crush of many. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>However, this beauty with a brain has&nbsp;never given&nbsp;an insight into her romantic life, which leads her curious admirers to think more about her intimate space. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>She Often Shares Photos with Her Male Friends</h2><p>Miss Frelund never shares a picture with her life partner, but she often uploads photos of herself with her male co-workers, which have, at times, created some unwanted <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">speculations</a> about her relationship with them. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In 2016, the blonde beauty&nbsp;posted a regular&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">selfie</a> with her co-worker Michael Irvin with his hands on her waist. The picture was captioned, “Pretty Sure @michaelirvin88 is the only person that makes a selfie stick cool … Happy #nfl Week 3! @NFLGameDay.”</p><p>Irvin was quick to respond to his co-worker with a double-meaning tweet, “Simply love pulling my stick out around you,” which was highlighted as inappropriate by the fans about the word "stick," and he deleted the tweet immediately. The tweet was somewhat <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">controversial</a> and misunderstood by the audience, so later, he clarified his intentions and the meaning of the “stick” as a “selfie stick” in his next tweet. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>The NFL Host Never Shies Away from Showing Love to Her Parents</h2><p>The celebrated&nbsp;sports television personality never fails to appreciate her family, especially her parents. She often shares appreciation posts for her parents on Instagram—in one such instance, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">posted</a> childhood pictures with her mom and dad with heartwarming captions of their contributions and importance in her life.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>As the saying goes, “There’s no love greater than a mother’s love, and no care is greater than a father’s care," it is the same for Frelund too.&nbsp;On June 17, 2018, she posted a childhood picture and her dad on Father’s Day. Similarly, she also uploaded a photo with her mom on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Mother’s Day</a> recently and wrote how much she means to her and loves&nbsp;her.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6OzrXnCsqWtoJmWeqe%2BxKWsp5xdncK0rsCnm2egpKK5</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
