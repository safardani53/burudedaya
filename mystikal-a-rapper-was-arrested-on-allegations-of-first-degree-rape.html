The rapper was arrested at 12.50 p.m. on Sunday, according to the Ascension Parish Sheriff’s Office. He allegedly committed the five claimed charges at 9:21 a.m. on the same day.</p><p>According to the Sheriff’s Office’s Inmate Detail Query, the 51-year-old rapper, also known as Michael Lawrence Tyler, is now awaiting arraignment and has not yet posted bond. Three of the five charges were felonies, while the other two were misdemeanors. The bond amount has not yet been established, according to the official record of the arrest from the Ascension Parish Sheriff’s Office. Furthermore, the day on which Tyler will be brought before the court has not been set.</p><p>Additional accusations were filed against the Louisiana native, including domestic abuse, domestic violence, simple robbery, and property damage. In Louisiana, the damage to the property caused by Tyler is considered a misdemeanor.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Mystikal-2.jpg alt=Mystikal width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>According to official documents, the damages totaled less than $1000. He was also accused of wrongful incarceration. Mystikal’s domestic violence battery felony also included strangling. However, this is not the rapper’s first time being convicted of s*xual battery. In 2004, he was likewise charged with the same offense.</p><p>He was sentenced to six years in jail at the time. Michael Tyler, a now-registered s*x offender, was convicted and sentenced to 90 days in jail on domestic violence charges against his then-partner in 2012, two years after his release. Mystikal was charged with s*xual assault again in August 2017 and freed on a $3 million bail. However, the accuser apparently abandoned the lawsuit due to a lack of evidence against Tyler.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Mystikal arrested for rape, strangulation, robbery, and more in Louisiana. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/yiYbkTvAy8</a></p><p>— Daily Loud (@DailyLoud) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">August 1, 2022</a></p><h2>Possible penalties and fines</h2><p>Because Mystikal was convicted in Louisiana, which has the highest incarceration rate in the United States, the rapper is likely to face another jail term.&nbsp;Furthermore, the Here I Go, musician, has past convictions in addition to his three crimes in the latest arrest. Thus, Michael Lawrence Tyler not only comes under Louisiana’s notorious Three Strikes statute but also exceeds its qualifications. According to this statute, Tyler might be prosecuted as a habitual offender, which carries the possibility of incarceration “at hard labor,” as stated by Eric John D. & Eric G. Johnson Law Firm.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Mystikal-3.jpg alt=Mystikal width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>For the r*pe charges, the 51-year-old New Orleans native could face life in jail without the chance of parole or early release. He may also face up to five years in jail without the possibility of release for the s*xual battery crime.&nbsp;Meanwhile, for the crime of domestic abuse violence, Mystikal faces a fine of $300 to $1,000, as well as a jail term of 30 days to six months.&nbsp;Similarly, for simple robbery, Mystikal may face a $3,000 fine and seven years in jail without hard labor. Finally, for his misdemeanor counts, Michael Lawrence Tyler faces a fine of up to $500 or six months in jail.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Mystikal</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Rapper</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiksquknriiuIyaZKuZoKWys3nWmqpmmaKnsrTAxJ1kqKZdlrmtscaaq6Knnqh6sLKMn6Crq6Risaaz0Z6cZqqRpbJw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
