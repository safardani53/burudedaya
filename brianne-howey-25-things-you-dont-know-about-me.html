The comedy-drama chronicles Georgia — a 30-something single mother&nbsp;&nbsp;— and her teenage daughter Ginny’s (<a href=#><strong>Antonia Gentry</strong></a>) journey as they navigate their new world after relocating to a small New England town.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">The California <a href=#>native made instant waves with her portrayal of the character</a>, receiving critical acclaim as the southern mom of two — but it took creators <strong>Debra J. Fisher</strong> and <strong>Sarah Lampert</strong> a while to find the perfect fit.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“Brianne was the last, literally, the last to be cast,” Fisher told&nbsp;<a href=#>Entertainment Weekly </a>just after the series premiere in February 2021. “We had to find the perfect Georgia, that balanced beauty that’s going to kill you with a smile but will stab you in the chest without seeing it coming. We met actresses from the U.S., Canada and England and on one of our last days, Bri got back from a European vacation and put herself on tape. … Monday morning, we brought her in read her with Toni and we were like, ‘We just found Ginny & Georgia. There they are.’”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">While Howey has nothing but love for her role, <a href=#>playing someone as complex as Georgia</a> does come with its difficulties. “The most challenging thing about playing Georgia Miller is how fast she can turn on a dime,” the Dollface alum told Us. “One second she’s your best friend, and the next, she’s threatening you.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Ginny & Georgia was renewed for a sophomore season just one month after it launched on Netflix. Season 2, which premiered in January 2023, debuted at No. 1 in the U.S. on the streaming service and appeared in the top 10 in 84 countries.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">While the Passage alum may be reaching A-list status herself these days, Howey is <a href=#>no stranger to being stopped in her tracks by a celebrity</a>, exclusively telling Us that a certain fellow blonde actress once left her gobsmacked.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">“The most starstruck moment I’ve had was with <a href=#><strong>Cate Blanchett</strong></a>,” she gushed. “She saw my jaw drop, she smiled, and I think I uttered something along the lines of, ‘I’m stunned to be in your presence.’”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Howey was also a big fan of <a href=#><strong>Julia Roberts</strong></a> growing up, someone she’s now told she resembles — “It’s one of the greater compliments of my life” — even requesting a VHS of Erin Brockovich for her 12th birthday so she could watch it on repeat.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">When it comes to swooning over her favorite actor, the Exorcist alum can also relate. “My celebrity crush growing up was <a href=#><strong>Joshua Jackson</strong></a>, all the way,” she said.</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Despite&nbsp;<a href=#>mingling with Hollywood stars on the regular</a>, however, Howey still lives a low-key life.&nbsp;<b>“</b>On a typical Sunday afternoon, I’ll be at the farmers’ market and home, doing laundry and cleaning,” she shared, adding that a Saturday night means “a fun dinner with good people, great food and even better drinks.”</p><p class="x_p3 x_ContentPasted0">Ginny & Georgia seasons 1 and 2 are now available on Netflix.
