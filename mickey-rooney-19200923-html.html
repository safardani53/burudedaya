Over a career spanning nine decades and continuing until his death, he has appeared in over 300 films and is one of the last living stars of the silent movie era. He was the first box office character from 1939 to 1941 and one of the highest paid actors of that era. At the height of his career marked by his downfall and return, Rooney portrayed Andy Hardy in a series of 16 films in the 1930s and 1940s, portraying America itself. At the peak of his career between the ages of 15 and 25, he made 43 films and was one of the most successful actors in MGM. As a versatile artist, he became a popular actor later in his career. Laurence Olivier once said that he considered Rooney "the best man of all time".</p><table class=wikibox readability=13.5><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>Ninnian Joseph Yule Jr, September 23, 1920, New York City, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Died</td><td class=wk_value>April 6, 2014, Los Angeles, California, U.S.</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Occupation</td><td class=wk_value>Actor, comedian, vaudevillian, radio personality, producer</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Years active</td><td class=wk_value>1926–2014</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Notable work</td><td class=wk_value>Filmography</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Children</td><td class=wk_value>9, including Tim, Michael, Teddy, and Mickey Jr.</td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=wk_label>Parent(s)</td><td class=wk_value>Nellie W.
