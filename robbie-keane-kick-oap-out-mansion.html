I cried on that phonecall and begged you 'please don't destroy my property'," she said.</p><p>Of Mr Lawrence, she added: "We were told because he was a famous person we were not allowed to have his telephone number. We have never seen him. I've never been offered any money."</p><p>Ms St Paul, in reply, said that if she didn't answer the door to tradesmen it was because of her health problems.</p><p>"I was hospitalised twice and had to take bed rest," she said. "If somebody were to knock on the door I wouldn't hear them from my window.</p><p>"Nobody was ever refused entry to that house. We've never been anything less than pleasant to anybody who came round even after my second stroke."</p><p>The court heard that Mr Lawrence had countersued the Keanes in a bid to offset the rent arrears against alleged failures to make repairs to the property, including a faulty entrance buzzer and to the underfloor heating system which Ms St Paul slammed as 'absolute rubbish'.</p><p>But the judge dismissed the counterclaim due to lack of evidence supporting it.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on The Sun">Read more on The Sun</h2><p>Striking out the bid to offset the back rent, Judge Baucher said both defendants had failed to engage with the owners of the house to 'allow access to assess disrepair'.</p><p>Speaking outside court after the hearing, Ms St Paul said: "Somebody said he was in football. I hate football."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/championnews-co-uk-tel-07948286566-823476941.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/c4af23f5-8d37-4ae3-8320-f67577c97ec8.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9zgpBwbXFvX6e8o67InmSknZGjsm63yJyiZqeRpXqwwdNmpJqmo568r3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
