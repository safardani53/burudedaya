He was simply “the right person at the right place in the right time,” as Winfrey, 66, put it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Mariah-Carey-Says-Derek-Jeter-Helped-Me-Get-Out-of-My-Marriage-to-Tommy-Mottola.jpg><p>“I don’t think it was like, ‘Oh, my gosh, he was the love of my life,’” Carey explained. “At the time I did because I didn’t think I would ever meet anybody who wouldn’t … feel superior to me because of the fact that I’m not one way or another in most people’s minds and they have preconceived notions or whatever. But he was a catalyst, and I think that it was beautiful.”</p><p>The “Hero” singer, who had a tumultuous childhood, said during the interview that she was particularly drawn to the baseball player because of his close bond with his parents.</p><p>“They changed my viewpoint that ‘Oh, it’s because of the biracial situation that my family is so screwed up’ as opposed to ‘It’s them,’” she said. “And yes, those things did play a huge part in [my parents’] disfunction, but it was healthy for me to see a functional family that basically kind of looked like mine but didn’t feel like mine. And he was also living his dream job and doing his dream job and stuff. I believe we connected in that way.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Tommy-Mottola-and-Mariah-Carey-in-1997.jpg><p>Mottola, now 71, discovered Carey in 1988 and signed her to Columbia Records, which he headed at the time. They started dating in 1992 while she was recording her third album, Music Box, and got married the following year. Creative differences drove them apart, and they separated in 1997.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Meaning of Mariah Carey author <a href=#>wed</a> <a href=#><strong>Nick Cannon</strong></a> in 2008.
