As Tyler came up to the bouncer, he said, ‘I have a knife on me.’ He pulled it out and handed it to the staff.</p><p>“All he was going on about was how he’d brought it from America because Donald Trump had said London wasn’t safe.</p><p>“They acted very calmly and dialled 999 and that’s when some local guys told him he’d get arrested. At that point he ran off.”</p><p>It is understood TJ later went back to the club to try to explain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000407746222.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Donald Trump compares London to 'war zone' saying stabbing attacks mean 'prestigious hospital' is like a military zone</span><p>The Met said: “The suspect had left the scene prior to police being called.
