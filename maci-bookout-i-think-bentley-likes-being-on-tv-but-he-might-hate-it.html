of life.</p><p>Most are in their thirties now, and MTV came calling when they were still in high school, meaning they’ve never really supported themselves with any kind of work.</p><p>But for as much as the life of semi-stardom has been normalized for the moms, it’s even more mundane for their kids, several of whom are now in their teens.</p><p>Take Maci’s son Bentley, for example.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>A 13, the boy is now old enough to understand how different his life is from the lives of his classmates.</p><p>But even though the camera crews have been around since he was a baby, Bentley must have moments where he wishes the whole world didn’t know about his family drama … right?</p><p>Well, not according to Maci.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><a href=#>Bookout sat down</a> with TooFab this week for one of the most revealing interviews of her career.</p><p>She revealed that she <a href=#>hasn’t spoken with Ryan Edwards in years</a>, and she also spoke candidly about her son with Ryan.</p><p>Sadly, it seems Bentley doesn’t have much of a relationship with his father these days, but on the bright side, it seems that the boy has no qualms about living his life in front of a camera.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“I will say I think it always stays the same, in a sense that since he was born on TV and been on TV his whole life and even the crew, camera operators, they’re just family now,” Maci told the outlet.</p><p>“I think it will always hold that normalcy for him,” she added.</p><p>“But I also think that, I’m surprised by this and I could be wrong, a year from now I could be like, you totally read that wrong, but I think in today’s world with social media and influencers, I feel like he’s actually becoming more appreciative of the platform and the work that it takes to make a TV show and the courage it takes for someone like me to put my life out there and the courage for him, because he’s shared a lot of things on the show.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Maci went on to admit that she could be wrong in her assessment of the boy’s feelings, saying:</p><p>“Like I said, a year from now I could be like, yep, I was wrong, he actually hates it and we’re done, but of all the conversations and things we talk about and things I notice, I think he’s coming to appreciate it as much as he can.</p><p>“It’s still annoying for him sometimes, but he knows he doesn’t have to film or wear a microphone if he doesn’t want to and that’s always been the case and production’s always done a really good job of letting the kids — no matter how big or small, old, young — if they don’t want to film, they’re not filming and that’s it and it’s okay.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>It’s good that Maci is keeping her eyes peeled for signs that her son might have grown dissatisfied with such a public life.</p><p>Hopefully, she’s doing the same for all of her kids.</p><p>And hopefully, she’ll step away if the show ever puts too much of a strain on any one of them.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share
