So, Grayson was born to Slade Smiley and Michelle Arroyo.</p><p>Thus, Grayson Smiley’s mother’s name is Michelle Arroyo. And Grayson also has an elder brother named Gavin.</p><p>As Slade and Michelle separated, Grayson grew up with his father, Slade, and not his mother.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_is_Grayson_Smiley_Father></span>Who is Grayson Smiley Father?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.nextbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Grayson-Smiley-pic.jpg><p>Grayson Smiley was the son of RHOC star Slade Smiley.

He was diagnosed with cancer in 2006, and since then, Grayson has undergone many treatments.</p><p>And a week before his death, Grayson had his CSF [cerebrospinal fluid] drawn, and the medical professionals tried to treat the abnormalities.

And she has shared a heart-warming message with Grayson, and here it is for our readers:</p><p>“Our rational minds told us this day might come, but our hearts always held onto the hope that this day would not come to fruition.”</p><p>We are beyond devastated and heartbroken over the loss of Gray. Grayson Arroyo-Smiley was such a special human being.</p><p>Remembering him as “an angel on earth” and “an incredible warrior,”</p><p>We can infer Gretchen Rossi’s caring nature from these messages.</p><p>Rossi is Grayson’s father’s fiancée, and she lives with Grayson.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Grayson_Smiley_Mother_Allegation></span>Grayson Smiley Mother Allegation<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In the media, Grayson Smiley’s mother, Michelle, claimed that Slade Smiley and Rossi did not properly care for their son. In addition to that, Slade went to jail regarding the child support amount problem.</p><p>As a result, Michelle emphasized it, adding that Slade and his fiancée’s negligence took his son’s life.</p><p>Here is the statement that Michelle Rossi shared with the media:</p><p>“I have stayed quiet year after year about the inexcusable behaviour and neglect by his father and his fiancée out of respect for my son, who wanted nothing more in this world than a real relationship with his father,</p><p>Lada Smiley and Gretchen Rossi have grossly misrepresented the true nature of their relationship with Grayson, which was virtually nonexistent.</p><p>But is this the correct way to accuse someone who has also lost his precious, sweet son?</p><p>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>Who is Zendaya’s Mother Claire Stoermer?</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Bottom_Line></span>Bottom Line<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Thus, we have explained Grayson Smiley’s parent information. Grayson’s mother, Michelle, is making allegations against her ex-husband.</p><p>There is no legal background behind this allegation; it can also be one way of expressing the sadness of a poor mother who just lost a son.</p><p>The end!</p><p>Do you want to send your virtual support to Grayson’s parents?
