Being nauseous is gone, but I’m still in that tired phase. Patiently waiting, & hoping it goes away soon since I’m in my 2nd trimester.”</p><p>Lloyd continued to detail her side-effects — which she said she never had with her 17-month-old son Lawson, whom she and Schroeder, 39, welcomed in October 2016.</p><p>“This time I’m battling the never ending pimples/boils on my chin. I get rid of one & then another pimple pops up in the morning😩. The headaches get to me because they never go away!!” she added, noting that “it doesn’t help when you have a screaming toddler around.”</p><p>She continued: “Besides that, everything else is going good so far! I go to the doctor Wednesday & find out what we are having!! So excited! This whole time I was thinking boy, & now I’m thinking girl. We will see…!!!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As previously reported, the couple — who met on season 11 of Big Brother in 2009 — <a href=#>announced their exciting news</a> during the March 23 episode of Daily Blast Live.</p><p>“We’re having a baby, but we don’t know what we’re having yet,” Schroeder said at the time.
