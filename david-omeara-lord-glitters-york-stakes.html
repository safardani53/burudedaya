The trip at York will suit him grand and the ground should be spot on for him.</p><p>“He ran a nice enough race in a steadily run Juddmonte International last season, I don’t think he will have any trouble at all getting the trip. He won over 1m2f on heavy in France before he joined us.</p><p>“He still shows the same enthusiasm that he has always done and his run at Ascot suggests he retains all his ability."</p><p>He has acquitted himself well in the USA, Dubai and Canada over the last few years, but a potential globe-trotting campaign later in the year will depend on Covid-19 restrictions.</p><p>He said: “We could go abroad again with him later in the year, it just depends how things are looking with the coronavirus restrictions.</p><p>“We will see how he runs at York at the weekend and then make a plan where we go next.</p><p>“We ran in the Sussex last year but we will swerve it this time as it’s shaping up to be a very hot race.”</p><p>O'Meara will also be hoping to land another of York's big prizes next month with <strong>Eagles By Day</strong>, who is a likely runner in the Ebor.</p><p>The four-year-old ran out a gutsy winner of the Silver Cup on his first start for the yard at the weekend, and his trainer holds him in the highest regard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/sun-racing-logo-11.jpg><p>He said: “We were very pleased with him on Saturday. He ran a nice race behind <strong>Japan</strong> at Royal Ascot last year, so he has always had a bit of class and we were delighted to see him come back to form.</p><p>“We could go to the Ebor or the Lonsdale Cup next, though I’m probably leaning towards the Ebor at this stage.</p><p>“He is a very lightly raced horse and hopefully he can make up into a very nice staying horse.</p><p>“I’m not sure how much longer <strong>Stradivarius</strong> will be around, he has been an exceptional stayer. But if for any reason he retires I like to think Eagles By Day could win one of those big staying races."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SEE ALL FREE BETS HERE</a></p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Incredible moment four horses involved in photo finish at Doncaster</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLWwvtKeqZqbmaO0cH2Ram9tcWRlfKWt1aKbZqedmq6zrYylpqucXZy5qsDTnqmsZamkv6x50q2YpJ2jZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
