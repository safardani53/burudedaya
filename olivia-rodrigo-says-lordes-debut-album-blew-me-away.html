In December 2023, she hinted that a follow-up was on its way by posting a pair of Instagram photos where she was “<a href=#>listening to myself</a>” while lounging around in pajamas.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The update came a month after she was riding the New York City subway and ran into a fan who subsequently shared their interaction via social media. A Lorde fan page picked up the photo and claimed that she was “testing her own album,” a factoid that Lorde confirmed. <a href=#>“I was, in fact, listening to myself</a>,” she commented.</p><p>If Lorde releases her fourth studio album in the coming months, it would be one of many potential highlights of the year for Rodrigo. The singer is currently nominated for six awards at the <a href=#>2024 Grammys</a>, including Record of the Year (“Vampire”), Album of the Year (Guts) and Song of the Year (“Vampire”). Rodrigo’s “Ballad of a Homeschooled Girl” will also compete for Best Rock Song, going up against The Rolling Stones (“Angry”), Queens of the Stone Age (“Emotion Sickness”), Boygenius (“Not Strong Enough”) and Foo Fighters (“Rescued”).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKaloaaerm6%2Bzp2pop%2BfYsCixdJmo6iqlJrAbrDEm6ytZZGhr7a5jJujnq9dorJurdaasGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
