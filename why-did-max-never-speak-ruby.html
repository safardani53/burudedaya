It's why he sometimes obsesses over toy police cars and ambulance trucks.</li><li>Max was molested by his grandma, leaving him traumatised. This apparently could explain why he creates the "Super Bunny" character in his head to protect him.</li></ul><h2>Does Max ever speak normally?</h2><p>The kids who originally grew up watching the show might be shocked to learn that in newer seasons, Max can actually string a sentence together and does speak normally.</p><p>On a YouTube clip showing Max talking, viewers shared their reactions in the comments.</p><p>One said: "The way I remember Max and Ruby is they had no parents and Max would only say one word the whole episode."</p><p>Another piped up: "I've watched less than a full minute of the newer seasons, and I don't like it ... It's the fact that Max is speaking in full sentences. The way I remember it is, there was a theme to each episode, and Max would repeat it over and over.</p><p>"And that would be the only word he'd say throughout the episode. (Example: if the episode was about Max wanting to play with his fire truck, he'd continuously repeat 'fire truck' throughout the duration of the episode, and that's all he'd say.)"</p><p>Kids of today won't have the same questions as the show's original fans.</p><h2>What else has changed about the show?</h2><p>The two bunnies also didn't seem to have parents who were around - that is at least until five seasons later when they are finally seen after 14 years of viewer speculation.</p><p>In an interview, show creator Rosemary Wells explained that in early seasons "we don't see Max and Ruby's parents because I believe that kids resolve their issues and conflicts differently when they're on their own".</p><p>“The television series gives kids a sense about how these two siblings resolve their conflicts in a humorous and entertaining way.”</p><p>So that explains that mystery.</p><p>It seems that Max And Ruby has evolved since its original viewership tuned in.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Again, fans had been questioning why their parents weren't in the original series.</p><p>One unhappy viewer tweeted: "The new Max & Ruby is uncomfortable, you can't just throw these parents on us after a decade with just grandma!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmR%2BdoSXa2tuZ6edxm6wyJ1kppmoYrumwsSrZKyolZa4br7Um7Bo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
