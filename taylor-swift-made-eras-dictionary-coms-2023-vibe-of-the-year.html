Or planning the next way we’ll reinvent ourselves,” read the announcement. “The new prominence of the word eras is a reminder that we can define our own eras however we want. What era are you in?”</p><p>Earlier this month, TIME named Swift their <a href=#>Person of the Year</a>, shortly after she racked up six more <a href=#>Grammy Award nominations</a>, including Album of the Year (Midnights), Song and Record of the Year (“Anti-Hero”).</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She previously took home <a href=#>10 trophies at the 2023 Billboard Music Awards</a>, tying Drake for most wins in the show’s history with 39 total. She also topped the box office with her Eras Tour concert film — and has found success in her personal life with her<a href=#> ongoing romance</a> with<strong> Travis Kelce</strong>.</p><p>“Eras,” it should be noted, is not Dictionary.com’s Word of the Year. That goes to “hallucinate,” which saw a 46 percent increase in lookups over the past 12 months.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuasZykv26%2F1qKdrWWdlrGmecSrmKxllJ6wtbXOp5irsV2YvK6%2FjGtna2tdq7ajsYyonWasmJp6urHAq2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
