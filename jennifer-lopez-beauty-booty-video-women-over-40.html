Models typically start their careers between 16 and 18 years old, and until the last decade, they were usually finished by 30.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Actresses have long complained that roles dried up once they hit 40. Male movie stars have typically been paired with much younger women, as their romantic on screen partners.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Hey, in real life – the phenomenon of middle aged men dumping their wives for much younger ,fresher, prettier and more fertile, women is a well-known phenomenon.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Fortunately, in 2014, Hollywood leading ladies like <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sofia Vergara</strong></a>, 42, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Halle Berry</strong></a>, 48, <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jennifer Aniston</a></strong>, 45, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nicole Kidman</strong></a>, 47, <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sandra Bullock</a></strong>, 50,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow</strong></a>, 41, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cameron Diaz</strong></a>, 42, have hit their 40s and more, and look even more beautiful, and are continuing to be cast in strong roles and command box office results. This new development in the entertainment world is changing the general perception of what it means to be a woman over 40 .</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Thank the Lord!</p><h3>JLo Twerks Alongside Iggy In&nbsp;‘Booty’ Video</h3><p id=content-paragraph-8>But now JLo, with this dramatically filmed&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> “Booty” video</a> takes the idea that a woman over forty is less attractive and desirable, and annihilates it!</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Jennifer has NEVER looked more stunning and her booty and body are in phenomenal shape! “Booty” shows “Jenny From The Block” in a series of skimpy swimsuits, all cut high over the backside, revealing plenty of naked tush.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>On top of that, JLo has paired herself with young hot female rap star, Iggy Azalea, and she literally goes booty to booty with her. The two stars rub butts, slide up each others backsides and twerk together.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>There’s not an iota of difference in the toned youthful appearances of their bottoms. They are both perfect. Not a speck of cellulite.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>If anything, Jennifer’s booty and thighs are even better and more muscular than Iggy’s!</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Listen, JLo is one of the most beautiful women in the world. And when it comes to being in shape and having terrific muscle tone, she clearly has a genetic head start. &nbsp;Not every woman over forty can look as gorgeous and sexy as JLo even if they work out. We have to accept that.</p><h3>JLo “Buckles Down” To Get That Booty</h3><p id=content-paragraph-14>But, I can tell you that Jennifer does work out – almost daily – in order to look as bootyfull as she does in “Booty.” She wouldn’t look like JLo either, if she didn’t work at it seriously.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>She has explained in <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>interviews</a> that “you got to work out, you got to watch what you eat. It’s a job,” and admits that when it comes to exercise, ” I don’t love it,” but she makes herself, “buckle down.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>Nevertheless, until recently, most women probably didn’t think that it was even possible to look as sexy, stunning and shapely at 45, as Jennifer Lopez does. Most probably would also never have even considered that it was acceptable behavior to twerk and shake their booties, even in private or at a dance club. But , why shouldn’t it be? J Lo points that out, by example.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>What Jennifer is doing is demonstrating that, if a woman wants to and can spend time in the gym and can stick to a mostly healthy diet (JLo indulges too sometimes), she can continue to look strong, sexy and in shape, at any age.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>Age need not diminish a woman’s physical power and desirability.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>Jennifer has never looked better or more in charge of her life and career. She has been in total command of her career as she has produced and then promoted her recently released album, A.K.A., most recently at the MTV VMAs, The Billboard Music Awards and Fashion Rocks.</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>Jennifer Lopez may be enjoying and using her fabulous form to entertain, sell music and to express herself creatively, but she’s also a role model to other career women.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>Her message is that your career can also keep blossoming and building at 45 and beyond.</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>She’s butt-kicking age to the curb as a limit on any woman. Now that’s a powerful message! Do you agree <strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>? Has JLo redefined over 40 for women? Let me know.</p><p id=content-paragraph-23><strong>— Bonnie Fuller&nbsp;</strong><br>[hl_twitter_followme username=”BonnieFuller” template=”bonnie-fuller” text=”Follow Bonnie!”]</p><h3>More Jennifer Lopez&nbsp;News:</h3><li><a href=#>‘Booty’ Music Video: Fans Go Wild Over Jennifer Lopez & Iggy Azalea</a></li><li>Jennifer Lopez Rocks Snakeskin From Head-To-Toe In Shortest Dress Ever</li><li>Jennifer Lopez Flaunts Abs In Tiny Crop Top — Get The Look</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlkZH16e5ByZqOdnqO2p7HRZqOoqJWveqOxwK6rsmWSpLy1xYyvoJ2dn2LEsLnEp2SorpWnenV8jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
