So I guess it’s about how social you are.</p><p>"Alcohol was there but a bit pricey for the added hassle of operating an event where people are drinking outside of one’s own home. No drugs - due to the big prison sentence - but weed aplenty."</p><p>The partygoer explained that the crowd at the rave was more men, but there were some women present.</p><p>He added: "I think there is fear amongst civilians but if you’re being sponsored to stay in Saudi, you are not a resident or have a nice passport, there isn't much worry."</p><p>DJs and performers are careful what they post while performing or attending unsanctioned underground raves in KSA.</p><p>But the detail in videos of the soirees is made glaringly clear to the observer: the majority of those attending are men, with only a spattering of women dotted throughout.</p><p>The influencer told The Sun that the raves remain majority male, but more and more women are joining in the festivities as attitudes shift in the country.</p><h2>SAUDI A-RAVE-IA</h2><p>Saudi Arabian culture is changing, and quickly.</p><p>In 2019, the formerly conservative country began what would have been unthinkable a few years prior.</p><p><a href=#>Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman</a> began a state-sanctioned rave as part of a multi-faceted governmental initiative called “Vision 2030”.</p><p>The rave is just a small part of the sweeping social changes brought by Prince Salman, who also made it <a href=#>legal for women to drive</a> and attend public events alongside men.</p><p>Mixed-gender events are now encouraged as well, something encompassed in the massive state rave, named Mdl Soundstorm, and a sister event called Mdl Beast.</p><p>Mdl Soundstorm is held yearly in the deserts surrounding Riyadh, bringing in thousands of young people to throw away their inhibitions, albeit with a few remaining restrictions.</p><p>Countless others on <a href=#>SubReddit Saudi Arabia</a> have reported instances of harassment towards women throughout the festival, however.</p><p>One woman shared: “I'm going with a group now. Heard it was horrible for women so I really didn’t want to take the chance by going alone. Sucks that I have to take precautions though.”</p><p>Mdl Sandstorm, which was labelled as part of a program to “support new liveable and lifestyle options in Saudi Arabia”, has shown the country still has a ways to go despite efforts to "modernise" from it's leader.&nbsp;</p><p>The festival has been labelled by many activists as an attempt to “clean” Saudi’s international image and make it more appealing to tourists.</p><p>Rights violations remain high in Saudi Arabia, with Amnesty International recording hundreds of detainments of human rights defenders, government critics, political activists and journalists.</p><p>Executions reached 147 people in 2022, and are traditionally done by beheading the "criminal" with a sword.</p><p>Yet, the allure of a sanctioned festival in the desert - and underground parties away from prying eyes - still draw a mass of people each year.&nbsp;</p><p>A Riyadh-based influencer told The Sun about the positives of the festival, which attracted 700,000 people last year.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>They said: "Mdl Sound Beast inspires people and other artists to change their perspective of Saudi Arabia and not find it a threat to visit the country.&nbsp;</p><p>“Instead they can come and have their gig here. It truly brings music lovers and connects people together from all around the world."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/cedric-gervais-performs-stage-mdlbeast-839859401.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/handout-picture-released-saudi-press-781721242.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ354hJdxcHBnpaOxpr7Gq6auppRivaK%2B06KcrGWjlsKltYyaqZqamZZ6s63VnmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
