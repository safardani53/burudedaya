I’m not trying to argue.’ And when I tried to remove myself from the situation, that’s when I guess she just got really angry.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Jamie-Lynn-Spears-Claims-Britney-Spears-%E2%80%98Got-in-Her-Face-When-Holding-Daughter-Ivey.jpg><p>The Mississippi native alleged that her now-13-year-old daughter, Maddie, “tried to mediate the situation,” saying, “I hated that. Like, that’s not what you’re supposed to do. You’re 12.”</p><p>When asked about her parents <a href=#><strong>Jamie Spears</strong></a> and<a href=#><strong> Lynne Spears</strong></a>’ responses to the situation, the actress replied, “They told me that I shouldn’t be upset. Like, I can’t upset Britney. I said, ‘You just saw me and my children be upset. When will I matter?’”</p><p>The <a href=#>Sweet Magnolias</a> star went on to describe another alleged incident with the Princess of Pop, saying that the “Circus” singer once locked herself and Jamie Lynn in a room with a knife because she was “scared.”</p><p>The All That alum recalled, “I was a kid in that moment. I was scared. That was an experience I had. But I also was fearful to, like, really say anything because I didn’t want to upset anybody or anything. But I also was upset that she didn’t feel safe.”</p><p>Jamie Lynn clarified to Chang, 56, that she “still” has “love” for Britney in clips aired on <a href=#>Good Morning America</a> Wednesday morning.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Jamie-Lynn-Spears-Claims-Britney-Spears-%E2%80%98Got-in-Her-Face-When-Holding-Daughter-Ivey-2.jpg><p>“I’ve only ever loved and supported her and done what’s right by her, and she knows that,” the “Shotgun Wedding” singer said. “I’ve always been my sister’s biggest supporter, so when she needed help, I set up ways to do so. [I] went out of my way to make sure that she had the contacts she needed to possibly go ahead and end this conservatorship and just end this all for our family. If it’s going to cause this much discord, why continue it?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Crossroads star’s conservatorship began in 2008, and <a href=#>it was terminated in November 2021</a>.</p><p>ABC News reached out to Britney and Jamie, 69, for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajmZ2esm642KelZqugmq6zv4ybqaKsnprGbrPOrWSipl2ixm6ywJycZq%2BYmrtutYywmKxlmKS5pbXNoGSirpWufA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
