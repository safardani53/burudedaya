We will work together in the best interests of our children, our family, community and businesses.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>No reason for the split was revealed in the statement. Emmitt and Pat, who was crowned Miss Virginia in 1993, just celebrated 20 years of marriage in April, and based on her Instagram post at the time, all seemed to be going well between them. In fact, she was absolutely gushing about her husband at the time, although she did allude to having some issues in the relationship over the years.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“20 years doesn’t come without a lot of work, prayer and a fight to stay together,” Pat wrote. “I have learned to keep my focus on our marriage and celebrate the beauty, uniqueness and challenges of ours! While continuing to grow together and as individuals, I can see that we are definitely not the two people we married 20 years ago!! I can truly say we are better people than we were then!! Marriage has a beautiful way of molding you and building you into the people God truly wants you to be!! And for that I celebrate today!!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>She concluded her post by adding, “Hubby, I love you so dearly and I’m extremely grateful for all that we have built together and for the love that we share together.” Along with the loving message, she shared a photo of herself an Emmitt together. In June, Emmitt and Pat happily celebrated their son’s high school graduation with family pictures together, as well.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Before Emmitt, Pat was married to&nbsp;<strong>Martin Lawrence</strong> from 1995 until 1997.
