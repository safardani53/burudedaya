I pulled a match and it was a long one.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Royals">Read More on Royals</h2><p>“When I learned they were not wearing seatbelts in the crash I understood why they didn’t survive. That shouldn’t have happened.</p><p>"It was standard practice for the family to wear seatbelts. It was an order sent down from the boss, Dodi’s dad <a href=#>Mohamed Fayed</a>. Dodi, in particular, hated wearing seatbelts and I always insisted on it.”</p><p>Through his work with Mohamed Al-Fayed — the owner of Hôtel Ritz <a href=#>Paris</a> and formerly Harrods department store and <a href=#>Fulham FC</a> — Lee also protected <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a>, <a href=#>Nicole Kidman</a>, <a href=#>Sylvester Stallone</a> and footballer <a href=#>Pele</a>.</p><p>Burnley-born Lee, who has covered his incredible career in personal protection in a new book, was assigned to look after Dodi and Diana, then 36, when they stayed at his boss’s 30-bedroom villa in St Tropez, in the South of France, during July 1997.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>Every day Diana would wake up at 7am and chat to the bodyguard. He said: “She had been happy on that holiday.</p><p>“But I had seen her in tears too, when she learned of the <a href=#>murder</a> of her friend, the fashion designer <a href=#>Gianni Versace</a>. She confided in me her own fears that she might one day be assassinated.</p><p>"She asked if I thought his murder outside his home was a professional killing.</p><p>“I thought it was. Then she said something that always stayed with me — ‘Do you think they’ll do that to me?’ She was shaking and it was clear from her tone that she really thought that they might, whoever ‘they’ might be.</p><p>“I spent some time reassuring her that no one was going to try to kill her and she was safe with us, but she definitely thought there was a risk that one day she might be assassinated.”</p><p>Diana also told Lee she wanted to live with Dodi in <a href=#>the States</a>.</p><p>She definitely thought there was a risk that one day she might be assassinated.</p><p>He added: “I actually signed up to join Diana and Dodi in America. She was definitely going, and that was that. She told me she was going there.</p><p>"She didn’t want to, but that was the only place she felt people weren’t having a go at her. It was probably her way of keeping sane, to get some respite.”</p><p>Lee took an instant shine to young princes <a href=#>William</a> and <a href=#>Harry</a>, who he says were down to earth and friendly, like their mother. William was 15 when Diana died and Harry 12.</p><p>Lee believes Diana’s plan to move to the US influenced Harry’s move there with <a href=#>Meghan</a>.</p><p>He said: “This trauma happened when the building blocks for life were being formulated. His mother saw America as a place of sanctuary. He will be drawing on his experiences from then.”</p><p>Lee, a martial arts expert, tried to teach William and Harry how to kickbox, but they were too apprehensive. He said: “I rigged up a punch bag in the garage.</p><p>“One day I told the princes, ‘Come on, I’ll teach you a bit of kickboxing’.</p><p>“When I showed William and Harry how to do it though, they seemed a little bit in awe from watching me kick that bag so hard and weren’t too keen to try it themselves in front of me.”</p><p>But Harry did challenge him to jump off the top deck of Al-Fayed’s yacht for money.</p><p>When Lee said he would do it for £200, Diana joined in the encouragement and told Lee they had his money.</p><p>We were generally followed by MI5 but this was the first time we had seen a Special Forces guy.</p><p>Lee said: “It was a bloody big yacht and a fair drop from its highest point into the water. A bet’s a bet, after all, and this one was by royal command, from an actual princess.</p><p>"So I jumped off the boat, hit the water with a big splash and they were all delighted, especially Harry.”</p><p>Lee — who has also served in the <a href=#>Military Police</a>, worked undercover for the Forces in <a href=#>Northern Ireland</a> at the height of the Troubles and in <a href=#>Somalia</a> and <a href=#>Libya</a> — does not believe Diana was murdered.</p><p>But he reveals the presence of intelligence services following her just weeks before the crash might have been a factor.</p><p>On a counter-surveillance drive near the Al-Fayed home in <a href=#>Surrey</a> just before they all went to St Tropez, one of Lee’s colleagues saw someone from the <a href=#>Special Reconnaissance Unit</a>, working on a building site. He knew him as they had both been in the <a href=#>SAS</a>.</p><p>Lee said: “We were generally followed by MI5 but this was the first time we had seen a Special Forces guy. We thought, ‘They’ve upped their game’.</p><h2>‘Magical time’</h2><p>“A witness driving a car travelling in front of the <a href=#>Mercedes</a> in Paris on the night of the crash told the inquest that he saw a high-powered motorbike overtake the car just seconds before the crash.</p><p>“Another witness travelling in the opposite direction saw a second motorbike swerve to avoid smoke and wreckage then carry on out of the tunnel without stopping. The riders of those bikes were never found — and that is no coincidence.</p><p>“I believe that security officers following Diana, possibly British or a combined British–French team, may have either inadvertently caused the crash or were in close proximity to the car when it happened.</p><p>“If it was known that <a href=#>MI6</a> operatives were right by the Mercedes at the critical moment, a lot of people would have blamed them for it, and that would have been a huge scandal.”</p><p>Lee will never know the truth. But he will always treasure the letter he received from the princess 25 years ago.</p><p>He said: “I received a lovely letter from Diana that was signed by her and both of the young princes.</p><p>“She told me she wanted to thank me for taking such good care of them all in St Tropez. I was blown away by that. She assured me that she and her boys had a ‘magical’ time there and that this wouldn’t have been possible without my help.</p><p>“I couldn’t believe that a woman as famous and in-demand as Diana had taken the time to write to me in that way.</p><p>“It showed the empathy she was rightly famous for.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>“Diana was almost always able to put herself in someone else’s shoes, it is one of the reasons why she was so highly regarded.</p><p>“She signed off with her warmest possible thanks. I still have that letter and will always treasure it.”</p><ul><li><strong>The Bodyguard, by Lee Sansum, (Seven Dials) will be out on September 1, £9.99.</strong></li></ul><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/b11bddb7-1915-4f62-ad94-f801fe84d254.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/NINTCHDBPICT000753094091.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5BybGlqZmd%2FcLzRoqWcnaOoeqW1wKeYZqSVmnq0rc2srKZlkqSxurPUmqmdZaCWv6q%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
