Based on her reported date of birth, the&nbsp;television personality is currently 52 years old. However, the claim which she made back in 2017 does not sit well with her reported age.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Before the Reunion episode, Christie's age was understood&nbsp;to be 47, a calculation based on her bios available online. However, while addressing the subject of one of her past feuds,&nbsp;Lozada called Christie to be 51 years of age.&nbsp;</p><p>In her response, the fashion designer refuted the claim and told everyone that she was not 51; instead, Christie claimed herself to be 61 years old.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Jackie Christie's Feud with Evelyn Lozada</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The highlight of the reunion episode was the feud&nbsp;surrounding Lozada, Christie, and Christie's daughter, who was the subject of the heated debate.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the initial part of the episode, Christie approached Lozada with calmness but soon after verbally&nbsp;attacked her and asked Lozada why she referred to Christine's daughter with rudeness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Christine further questioned Lozada why she had some "choice words" for her daughter after Christine left one of Lozada's earlier parties.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>In her clarification, Lozada told Christine how it wasn't "about your daughter," but about Christine's remark regarding Lozada's daughter. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Per Lozada, Christine called her daughter to be a [expletive] while Lozada was present with her daughter.&nbsp;</p><p>Christine then spoke strongly and asked Lozada not to "ever disrespect me" in front of "myself."
