which form part of a 2015 civil defamation suit brought by Virginia against Epstein's former lover and sex trafficker&nbsp;<a href=#>Ghislaine Maxwell</a>.</p><p>Unless anyone appeals, the documents are set to be made public any time from January 1 onwards.</p><p>They are expected to reveal more about Epstein's trafficking crimes - and just how far his network reached.</p><p>The dossier&nbsp;includes dozens of unnamed and understood to be high profile men and women who could be unmasked.</p><p>It's understood documents relating to some of Epstein's inner circle - who were identified in his black book of contacts - will be released.</p><p>At least seven of the "John Does" in the court ruling are described as "public figures" or as having some form of relationship with Epstein.</p><p>It also states that many of those currently unnamed in the case have spoken to the press about&nbsp;<a href=#>Epstein</a>&nbsp;- and therefore their identities can now be revealed.</p><p>These include some of&nbsp;<a href=#>Epstein's victims</a>, those who have made public allegations against him, or testified publicly at Maxwell's criminal trial.</p><p>They will include documents about one of&nbsp;Prince&nbsp;<a href=#>Andrew's accusers</a>&nbsp;- Johanna Sjoberg - who alleges that he&nbsp;<a href=#>groped her at Epstein's</a>&nbsp;New York mansion.</p><p>Others who are expected to be identified include a "member of&nbsp;<a href=#>law</a>&nbsp;enforcement", a "journalist who investigated Epstein," and a "medical provider".</p><p>It is not suggested they are accused of any wrongdoing.</p><p><a href=#>The new files set to be released in January</a> are likely to involve emails, legal documents, depositions and more.</p><p>Documents relating to several people who "played a role in Epstein's sex trafficking" will be unsealed, the court ruling says.</p><p>Judge Preska gave two weeks to those set to be named for them to object.</p><p>Responding to the ruling, Virginia said: "There’s going to be a lot of nervous ppl over Christmas and New Years, 170 to be exact, who’s on the naughty list?"</p><p>Virginia and Maxwell's defamation case was settled with confidential terms, but hundreds of pages of documents have been released over the last few years.</p><p>In other unsealed documents, Virginia described seeing&nbsp;<a href=#>Clinton on Epstein's island</a>&nbsp;and described&nbsp;<a href=#>Trump as a "friend"</a>&nbsp;of Epstein.</p><p>Clinton and Trump are both known to have been pals with Epstein - but neither former president has even been accused of wrongdoing over their association with Epstein and Maxwell.</p><p>In other documents, it is mentioned she was trafficked to a "Prime Minister", "foreign presidents" and "many other powerful men".</p><p>Its unclear which country the alleged mystery PM is from.</p><p>Virginia also claimed she was trafficked to Epstein's lawyer Alan Dershowitz, model scout Jean Luc Brunel, billionaire Glenn Dublin, former US Senator George Mitchell, and New&nbsp;Mexico&nbsp;governor Bill Richardson.</p><p>All the claims are strongly denied by the men - but's it's understood they could be named in the new batch of court documents.</p><p>Numerous high profile names were dropped during Maxwell's trial for sex trafficking - including Trump, Clinton and Andrew.</p><p>Others named included Kevin Spacey, Chris Tucker, violinist Itzhak Perlman, and US Senators John Glenn and George Mitchell.</p><p>None have ever been accused of wrongdoing and it shows the web of the rich and powerful insidiously assembled by Epstein and Maxwell.</p><p>Epstein, 66, was&nbsp;<a href=#>found dead</a>&nbsp;in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial for&nbsp;sex trafficking.</p><p>Virginia alleged that she was recruited by Maxwell, the daughter of disgraced tycoon Robert Maxwell, as a teenage “sex slave” for&nbsp;<a href=#>Epstein</a>.</p><p>She also claims she was&nbsp;<a href=#>introduced to Prince Andrew</a>&nbsp;by Epstein, and that the royal had sex with her when she was 17 -
