I believe they know the truth now but aren't brave enough to live in it."</p><p>Discussing her terrifying experience with Bill, she claims the abuse took place in Frisco, Centennial, and Steamboat Springs Colorado from halfway through her 8th grade year through high school.</p><p>"We lived in three different homes during that time.

He knew that I was terrified. It took me years to gain the strength to come forward.</p><p>"My husband and my three kids have been incredibly supportive. As have my friends that stepped up and supported me. And have become family.</p><p>"'I support you!’ ‘I believe you!’ These two short statements carry so much power and so much importance to a victim of sexual assault. And yet, too few victims get to hear these words.</p><p>"The MeToo movement has been near and dear to my heart since I came forward with my own MeToo experience in late 2013.</p><p>"Coming forward, I desperately wanted to hear these words from my family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/03/NINTCHDBPICT000396958459.jpg><p>"I have never had a conversation with anyone in my family, except my husband and age appropriate talks with my kids, about the abuse.</p><p>"I was told when the investigation started in 2014 that they had made up their minds, they didn't believe me and nothing would change that."</p><p>Carissa was left heartbroken by the fact none of the family, except her husband and a close friend, attended the court appearances after telling investigators they didn't believe her.</p><p>"I have no idea where they got their information from in order to make a decision about believing me or not, except from Bill," she said.</p><p>"I have never been given the opportunity to sit with any family and tell my side of the story; they don't want to hear it.
