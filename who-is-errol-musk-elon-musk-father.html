In addition to Elon, Errol is dad to son <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Kimbal Musk</a> and daughters <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Tosca</a>, Alexandra and Asha Rose Musk. He has also fathered two children, a son and a daughter, with his stepdaughter Jana Bezuidenhout.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though Errol has made headlines in recent years after the births of his two youngest children, he seemingly avoids the spotlight. While he has given a few rare interviews, much of the publicly known information about him has come from his estranged son Elon or his ex-wife <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Maye Musk</a>, neither of whom have had complimentary things to say about the engineer and onetime emerald mine owner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's what to know about Elon Musk's estranged father, Errol Musk.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-he-comes-from-a-family-of-adventurers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>He comes from a family of adventurers</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In a rare <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>interview with Forbes</a>, Errol revealed that his parents were the first to ever fly from South Africa to Australia in a single-engine airplane. His grandmother broke barriers of her own, becoming the first-ever chiropractor in Canada.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-he-claimed-he-was-the-co-owner-of-an-emerald-mine></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>He claimed he was the co-owner of an emerald mine</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>GIANLUIGI GUERCIA/AFP</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Errol <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>told Business Insider South Africa</a> that he once owned half of an emerald mine in Zambia, which he claimed to have purchased on a whim. Errol and a co-pilot were flying a plane from South Africa to England to sell the aircraft — but when they couldn't make a scheduled stop in Saudi Arabia, he pivoted his plan and changed his life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We were going to fly into Jeddah and there was a religious holiday, and they said if we come in now we have to pay $2,000, but if we wait 10 days we can come in at no charge," he recalled to Business Insider. "So we decided to head back to Lake Tanganyika from where we were, I think we were in Djibouti."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While in Djibouti, he and his co-pilot sold their plane to some Italian nationals. "We went to this guy's prefab [home] and he opened his safe," Errol said. "There was just stacks of money and he paid me out, £80,000, it was a huge amount of money." The buyer also offered Errol the option to buy half of an emerald mine with that cash.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I said, 'Oh, all right.' So I became a half owner of the mine," he told the outlet. "And we got emeralds for the next six years."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-he-says-the-mine-made-him-extremely-wealthy></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>He says the mine made him extremely wealthy</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>GIANLUIGI GUERCIA/AFP</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In an interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Business Insider South Africa</a>, Errol admitted that, at one point, he literally made more money than he could physically handle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We were very wealthy. We had so much money at times we couldn't even close our safe," Errol said, explaining that one person would hold the money down while a second would slam the safe door shut. "And then there'd still be all these notes sticking out and we'd sort of pull them out and put them in our pockets."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Errol also shared how his sons got involved in the family business and recalled a time when Elon and his brother Kimbal sold a few of the emeralds from his mine to Tiffany & Co. in New York City.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They just walked into Tiffany's and said, 'Do you want to buy some emeralds?'

"He didn't own an emerald mine & I worked my way through college, ending up ~$100k in student debt," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Elon tweeted</a> in December 2019.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Elon also denied that Errol invested in the company. "One thing he claims is he gave us a whole bunch of money to start, my brother and I, to start up our first company. This is not true," Elon told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Rolling Stone</a> in 2017. "My brother and I paid for college through scholarships, loans and working two jobs simultaneously. The funding we raised for our first company came from a small group of random angel investors in Silicon Valley."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-elon-credits-him-for-his-own-engineering-skills></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Elon credits him for his own engineering skills</strong></span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Elon has said one of the reasons he is so skilled at engineering is because of his father. "I'm naturally good at engineering that's because I inherited it from my father," he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told Rolling Stone</a>. "What's very difficult for others is easy for me.

He <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told The New York Times</a> that as a member of the Progressive Party, he opposed apartheid. Errol also added that his children were keenly aware of the country's government-sanctioned racial segregation. "They were confronted by it every day," he said. "They didn't like it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, Errol also told the outlet that life in apartheid South Africa was ultimately "better" and "safer" than it is today.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-he-blames-himself-for-his-divorce-from-maye-musk></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>He blames himself for his divorce from Maye Musk</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kevin Mazur/MG22/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In his interview with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Business Insider South Africa</a>, Errol said that he was to blame for his divorce from model Maye Musk, with whom he shares Elon, Kimbal and Tosca.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I screwed up the marriage, I was totally responsible. It didn't work out too well in the end," he said. "My [former] wife doesn't speak to me, even when we're together, she won't speak to me, so we haven't spoken to one other for 37 years. She won't speak to me or engage me if we're in the same room — which we have been often."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Errol admitted to having affairs, but his ex-wife, now a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model</a>, said the problems in their marriage extended beyond infidelity, alleging that Errol was abusive.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Everybody I knew called him 'the Pig' because he treated me so badly in public. And I was too scared to tell anyone [about his violence]," Maye <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told Harper's Bazaar</a> in 2019. "Like every abused woman, I was embarrassed, and I knew I had made a mistake, you know? ... He told me over and over that I was stupid, ugly, boring."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added, "He was very rich, but he made sure I had nothing.

Jana was 4 years old when Errol married her mother, Heide Bezuidenhout — though he claims that he didn't consider Jana his stepdaughter, as she primarily grew up separate from the Musks. Errol and Heide had two children together, Alexandra and Asha Rose.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Errol and Jana welcomed a son, Elliot "Rushi" Rush, in 2017 and a daughter in 2019. He confirmed the birth of their daughter to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Sun</a> in 2022.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She wasn't planned," Errol said of his youngest child.

[Jana] stayed here for about 18 months after Rushi was born."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2018, he explained that he was helping Jana get over a breakup at the time of Rushi's conception, but he initially assumed the baby's father was Jana's ex. "We were lonely, lost people," Errol said. "One thing led to another — you can call it God's plan or nature's plan."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though he claimed Elon and Kimbal were upset with him for fathering a child with a woman they felt was "their sister," Errol told The Sun, "The only thing we are on Earth for is to reproduce.

"Almost every evil thing you could possibly think of, he has done … It's so terrible, you can't believe it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Tesla founder also said there was no way to repair his relationship with his father. "In my experience, there is nothing you can do," he added. "Nothing, nothing. I wish. I've tried everything. I tried threats, rewards, intellectual arguments, emotional arguments, everything to try to change my father for the better, and he… no way, it just got worse."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For his part, Errol told the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Mail</a> that Elon "needs to grow up" and "get over himself," adding, "I'm not going to hit back.
