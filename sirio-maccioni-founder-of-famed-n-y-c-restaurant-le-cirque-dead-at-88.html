Maccioni opened other outposts of Le Cirque in Las Vegas, Dubai and several cities in India, as well as sister restaurants, named Circo, in New York, Dallas and Abu Dhabi.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2014, Maccioni received The James Beard Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Many famous chefs who worked under Maccioni paid tribute to the late restaurateur Monday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I owe him all the respect and admiration for all that he did for me and my career as a chef,” Boulud, who went on to run a multiple Michelin-starred restaurant, wrote of Maccioni in an Instagram <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>post</a>. “No one in the business was more elegant, savvy, and confident in running the dining room of #lecirque. Sirio always gave me a lot of energy to cook my heart out in the kitchen. He gave me the chance to learn how to be a great chef, and a great host.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Torres, a pastry chef who now owns a chain of eponymous chocolate shops, said Maccioni gave him “the ability & platform to show my craft.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“There will never be another like you,” Torres <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>said</a> in a Tweet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Maccioni is survived by his wife, Egidiana, and their three sons, Mario, Marco and Mauro.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5akvKV70qKpoqddoq6kr8iopaJllqTCr7DEq2Sonl2brq6xw2alZrFdmHqzsdKtmK6qkaPBbrjEZpqiqqGqsm6wxJqbZpmkYoV5ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
