He is considered the pioneer of Afrobeat, an African musical genre that combines traditional Yoruba and Afro-Cuban music with funk and jazz. At the height of his popularity, he was considered one of Africa's most “inspiring and charismatic” musical artists. AllMusic describes him as a “musical and political social voice” of international significance. Kuti is the son of Nigerian women's rights activist, Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti. After initial experiences abroad, he and his group Africa 70 became stars in Nigeria in the 1970s, during which time he was an open critic and a target of the Nigerian military. In 1970, he founded the Republican Municipality of Kalakuta, which declared its independence from the military regime. The town was destroyed in a raid in 1978. Since his death in 1997, his re-distribution and compilation of music have been overseen by his son, Femi Kuti.</p><table class=wikibox readability=25><tr readability=2><td class=wk_label>Birth name</td><td class=wk_value>Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Also known as</td><td class=wk_value>Fela Anikulapo Kuti</td></tr><tr readability=9><td class=wk_label>Born</td><td class=wk_value>October 15, 1938, Abeokuta, Western Region, British Nigeria, (now Abeokuta, Ogun State, Nigeria)</td></tr><tr readability=6><td class=wk_label>Died</td><td class=wk_value>August 2, 1997, Lagos, Lagos State, Nigeria</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Genres</td><td class=wk_value>Afrobeat, highlife</td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=wk_label>Occupation(s)</td><td class=wk_value>Singer-songwriter, musician, activist</td></tr><tr readability=7><td class=wk_label>Instruments</td><td class=wk_value>Saxophone, vocals, keyboards, trumpet, guitar, drums</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Years active</td><td class=wk_value>1958–1997</td></tr><tr readability=9><td class=wk_label>Labels</td><td class=wk_value>Barclay/PolyGram, MCA/Universal, Celluloid, EMI Nigeria, JVC, Wrasse, Shanachie, Knitting Factory</td></tr><tr readability=13><td class=wk_label>Associated acts</td><td class=wk_value>Africa '70, Egypt '80, Koola Lobitos, Nigeria '70, Hugh Masekela, Ginger Baker, Tony Allen, Femi Kuti, Seun Kuti, Roy Ayers, Lester Bowie</td></tr><tr><td class=wk_label>Bandcamp artist ID</td><td class=wk_value>felakuti</td></tr></table><p>Saxophonist Fela Kuti was born in Abeokuta, Nigeria on October 15, 1938.
