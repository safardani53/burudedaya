I’m sick of being humble. I really am.”</p><p>“‘So sorry I’m rich, so sorry I’m married to a movie star, so sorry I’m not so bad looking.’ No sorrys. Enough.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/michael-douglas-wife-713x1024.jpg><p>Dang, Catherine, tell us how you really feel.</p><p>“All that is important to me now is my work,” she continued. “That’s what I love and the rest of my life is a joy because I’ve got two beautiful kids and a healthy, happy husband.”</p><p>“It’s all good, and I’m not going to be humble for that either.”</p><p>She explained that “I come from a working-class family in Wales and I worked to get where I am. And for many years all of us are victims of the fact that we’ve all got so humble.”</p><p>For example, she said “If you were a sports star and won an award you would go, ‘Sh-t yeah, that was the best work I’ve ever done, I rocked!'”</p><p>“Whereas actors are like, ‘Oh I’m so sorry and thanks, can I say thanks?'”</p><p>So that’s … well, that’s a lot to take in, right?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>On one hand, good for her. She really did work to get where she is, and she’s allowed to be proud of that.</p><p>But on the other hand … come on now.</p><p>Being humble is not the same as being apologetic — nobody thinks she needs to apologize for being successful and pretty.</p><p>It would be weird if she was actually like she’s suggesting here, going around apologizing for the good things in her life, but again, that’s not the same thing as being humble.</p><p>And according to Twitter, she could really, really do with learning that lesson.</p><p>“Let’s all take a moment and hope for the best for Catherine Zeta-Jones,” one person wrote. “She’s struggling, but determined to not let her staggering wealth, beauty and success drag her into the abyss.”</p><p>A true inspiration, right?</p><p>On a more direct note, another person asked “Who gives a sh-t about Catherine Zeta Jones? She hasn’t been relevant for years?”</p><p>One Twitter user wrote “A few questions and statements: 1) when have actors had to ASK to say thank u? 2) your last BIG movie was Chicago in 2002. Girl, bye. 3) as Kendrick Lamar said, ‘sit down, be humble’ 4) slow your roll, God gives and takes away.”</p><p>Then, one particularly savage person simply asked “Who is Catherine Zeta-Jones?</p><p>While many people were ready to tear her apart for these remarks, a few applauded her — one of those people tweeted “When I grow up I want to be Catherine Zeta-Jones.”</p><p>Someone else pointed out that if a man had made those same remarks “no one would bad an eyelid,” but “because she has a pair of tits & is honest you all have an issue.”</p><p>That could be true, but really, even if she was a man, her statements would still be ridiculous.</p><p>Literally no one thinks she has to apologize for anything, and it’s strange that she thinks anyone might.</p><p>Maybe she could start out by looking of the definition of “humble” and going from there … because it seems like she could really benefit from that.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WDcK%2FArZ%2Beqpmjsm7GxK2YZqKfo7K0ecimZKuhk516orrDZpmemaWptqfBy2aYp5xdnrpuus6tZKynoqfGcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
