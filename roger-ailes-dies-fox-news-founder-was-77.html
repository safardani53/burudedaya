He has dramatically and forever changed the political and the media landscape.”</p><p>“Single-handedly for the better.”</p><p>The cause of death of Roger Ailes was not immediately clear, and Fox News of all networks was slower than most to announce the news.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/07/roger-ailes-788x1024.jpg><p>Fox anchor Bill Hemmer, looking shaken, first reported Ailes death to his audience, ending his brief report by saying, softly, “Wow!”</p><p><a href=#>Ailes resigned from Fox News</a> last summer following a storm over a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by former anchor Gretchen Carlson.</p><p>The suit triggered similar claims from other women and an in-house investigation at Fox, and indirectly to <a href=#>Bill O’Reilly getting fired</a> as well.</p><p>Ailes strongly denied the claims against him, but stepped down with a multi-million dollar settlement from Fox that softened the blow.</p><p>Gabriel Sherman, who wrote a biography entitled The Loudest Voice in the Room, called this tragic, “whatever you think of Roger Ailes.”</p><p>“It is a “tragic, sad morning,” Sherman tells MSNBC, noting, “After all he built in his career, he for all practical purposes died alone.”</p><p>Twenty-First Century Fox, the parent company of Fox News chaired by Rupert Murdoch, issued its own statement moments ago.</p><p>Murdoch praised&nbsp;Ailes for his “remarkable contribution” and said he “shared my vision of a great and independent television organization.”</p><p>Ailes, he said, “executed it brilliantly over 20 great years” after beginning his career in the&nbsp;1960s as a producer at The Mike Douglas Show.</p><p>He went on to serve as a media consultant for several Republican presidents of the U.S., including Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.</p><p>In 1996, Murdoch, seeing a market for a conservative cable news outlet in a sea of liberal-leaning media, hired Ailes to create Fox News.</p><p>The rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>Ailes molded the network to run more like a campaign operation, with shows that were unabashedly conservative and politically divisive.</p><p>People gravitated to this model, which began to influence not only political coverage but politics itself in a way that was unprecedented.</p><p>Even those who came to loathe the network cannot help but acknowledge its status as a perennial, game-changing ratings juggernaut.</p><p>Fox News eventually ousted CNN as the highest rated cable news network and became one of the most popular networks of all genres.</p><p>More than 90 million households regularly tune in, a figure that would have been scoffed at had it been predicted in the late ’90s.</p><p>Ailes’ crowing achievements were sullied somewhat, however, in his final months at the network by the charges of sexual misconduct.</p><p>The parent company confirms that it has paid upwards of $45 million in settlements related to harassment allegations against Ailes.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Celebrities Who Died in 2017: In Memoriam</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper
