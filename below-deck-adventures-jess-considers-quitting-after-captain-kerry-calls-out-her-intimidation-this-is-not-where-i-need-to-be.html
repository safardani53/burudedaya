It has got to stop,” the captain tells Jess in Us Weekly‘s exclusive sneak peek <a href=#>at the upcoming episode of Below Deck Adventure</a>, which premieres on Tuesday, January 24. “The girls can’t be walking out feeling like they are walking on eggshells because it f—ks their job. It’s a big spiral.”</p><p>Kerry points out Jess’ attitude <a href=#>after she says she reached her “boiling point”</a> in the clip. “I don’t want any more negativity in the galley. It’s bordering on intimidation what you are doing down there. I won’t accept it,” he continues. “The way you are talking to the other staff is unacceptable. People are scared to go in the galley.”</p><p>According to Kerry, Jess’ <a href=#>actions are affecting everyone who works with her on board</a> the Mercury.</p><p>“She’s at her worst when she’s needed the most. I don’t care if we have one day left, I can’t keep being a sounding board to this f—king ongoing bitching,” he explains in a confessional.</p><p>The South Africa native, for her part, reveals she <a href=#>has considered walking away from the position</a>, saying, “Maybe I have come to the end of my yachting experience because this sure as hell does not bring me joy anymore. And my rule is, ‘If it’s not a f—k yes than it is a hell no.’ Like it’s made it very apparent to me that this is not where I need to be. … I can’t do that though. I can’t do anything else. I am just over it.”</p><p>The tense exchange comes after Jess struggled to get on the same page with the interior team. Chief stew <a href=#><strong>Faye Clarke</strong></a>, whose team <a href=#>includes stews <strong>Oriana Schneps</strong> and </a><strong>Kasie Faddah,</strong> previously found herself at odds with Jess during service.</p><p>Ahead of Below Deck Adventure‘s premiere, Kerry <a href=#>offered a glimpse at the obstacles he faced</a> when it came to his crew.</p><p>“Everyone is coming from different places, backgrounds and ages. They all have their own intentions, and we all have to find our own footing. Understand a brand new boat in a totally new country,” he told TV Insider in October 2022. “That puts pressure on everybody. For me, it’s understanding that everyone is human. Everyone gets a pass, but if you start taking my kindness for weakness, that’s when I change gears.”</p><p>Jess’ potential departure comes after Kerry let deckhand <a href=#><strong>Kyle Dickard</strong></a> go for picking fights with <strong>Nathan Morley</strong>. “I feel that he is a threat to the safety of other crew members,” the Australia native <a href=#>told bosun <strong>Lewis Lupton</strong> about the rif</a><a href=#>t</a> in a November 2022 episode. “So when I bring this up with Kyle, he has the right to explain himself. But these actions are grounds for instant dismissal.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Texas native was <a href=#>ultimately offered the opportunity to resign so the incident</a> wouldn’t go on his record. Kyle <a href=#>chose to walk off the boat after one charter</a> amid the drama.</p><p>Below Deck Adventure airs Tuesdays on Bravo at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmepJ%2BseqWxwqRkmpymmru1wdGeqmailajAbq%2FOp6qinJWnwG691KKrraGenHqistOeqWabkaXBorXNZqKeqqKueqSty6WqZqelqXqpsdFmoKesmaK2pa3ToqanZaSdtrR5yKxkp6ekYsSpsdGeZKJlnpqypXnTqGSbnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
