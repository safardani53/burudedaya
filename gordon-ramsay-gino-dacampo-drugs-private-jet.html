They're so f***ing lazy, they make me look good.</p><p>"An hour in Gino wants an espresso, or he wants his eyebrows plucked, ninety minutes in, <a href=#>Fred</a>'s missing his croissant and his eyeliner.&nbsp;</p><p>"So we do get on, but three or four days in it's like, 'Move over, I want more room in the bed', or, 'Can we have a break?' They don't work hard."</p><p>He further tore strips off Gino on Spencer Matthews' podcast Big Fish by revealing he discovered the Italian uses four levels of "platforms" hidden in his shoes to make himself look taller.</p><p>Sharing Gino's secrets, Gordon added: "His pizzas are s**t anyway and he knows that.</p><p>"He knows that my pizzas are better than his pizzas. My dough is fresh, it's proven.
