(Did I mention he’s super-handsome?)</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>I figured that executive producer&nbsp;<strong>Jeff Davis&nbsp;</strong>was saving Scott’s dad for a rainy day, and I’m actually glad he sprung him on us without warning, rather than build up his reveal and create unnecessary hype. We already knew Scott’s mom was to thank for his olive complexion, and now we know where Scott gets his strong nose! (Thanks, Dad.)</p><h3>#Stydia, At Last</h3><p id=content-paragraph-4>Speaking of building hype, we finally got to see Lydia (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Holland Roden</strong></a>) and Stiles’ long-awaited kiss this week, though it wasn’t much more than we were already shown in the mid-season trailer. At least now we know there wasn’t any romantic connection to the lip-lock; it was just Lydia’s way of calming Stiles down in the middle of his panic attack.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Still, there’s definitely&nbsp;something&nbsp;between them. After all, when Dr. Deaton paired up the three sacrifices — Scott, Stiles and Allison — with someone they had an emotional connection to, he didn’t hesitate to match up Stiles with Lydia. His decision to pair Allison with Isaac (<strong>Daniel Sharman</strong>) certainly raised a few eyebrows, though.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Seriously, did that guy get his PhD in&nbsp;shipping?</p><h3>Derek Gets Desperate</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>Meanwhile, with Cora (<strong>Adelaide Kane</strong>) still on the brink of death, Peter (<strong>Ian Bohen</strong>) offered Derek&nbsp;a last resort to save her: He could absorb her poison and heal her, but it would mean giving up most of his power as an alpha. There always has to be a catch, doesn’t there?</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Unsurprisingly, Derek decided to go ahead and heal her, so we watched as his eyes reverted back to that beautiful shade of innocent-killing blue.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>It was a noble gesture, to be sure, but riddle me this: What’s the use of a powered-down Derek in these troubled times?</p><h3>Morrell To The Story</h3><p id=content-paragraph-10>Here’s where things got a little confusing: When the evil alphas tracked down Ms. Morrell (<b>Bianca Lawson</b>), they forced a ton of information out of her. Most of it made sense, but what did she mean when she said she’s just like Jennifer (<strong>Haley Webb</strong>)? She couldn’t possibly be a darach too, could she?</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Her character has been all over the place since we first met her last season, so it wouldn’t totally surprise me if she made yet another crazy leap.&nbsp;We’ll get all of our answers — or at least some&nbsp;of them, hopefully — during next week’s mid-season finale.</p><h3>WATCH: <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Tyler Posey Previews Mid-Season Finale Surprises</a></h3><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-12><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what did you think of this week’s episode, and what do you think will happen on the mid-season finale?
