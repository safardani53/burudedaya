Wellllll …</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Apparently, this past Friday, Brittany was out of town, and Jax took the opportunity to go out partying with some of his male friends.</p><p>But in news that won’t shock anyone who’s ever watched like 5 seconds of Vanderpump, it wasn’t very long before some females got involved in the boys’ night. Allegedly.</p><p>An LA-based fan of the show tweeted and deleted accusations that she and Jax got it on in a bathroom stall.</p><p>Ya know, as one does when one is pushing 40 and newly engaged to be married.</p><p>Jax opted not to comment on the allegations, and instead went off on a random fan who brought the rumor to his attention, because uncontrollable rage is a delightful quality in a future husband.</p><p>Here’s a bit of that exchange:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"It’s all good we need haters too.. people only talk shit when they are jealous or want to be a hater, remember that haters make the world go round. Have a good one!!" Jax tweeted.</p><p>".@talktrashy2me not being mean but we are a successful show that’s been on for many many years, people who still show hate are sad, and have to realize we aren’t going anywhere, so you might as well join The vanderpump party!!"</p><p>He added:</p><p>"This means you are a middle aged person who is not happy with the way life turned out, they never made a jump to anything bigger and now regretting it, then they see people on tv that they actually “like” mind you, you don’t troll people you hate, you ain’t foolin anyone."</p><p>Wow. Sounds like Mr. Taylor has been getting into the pasta again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Look, if the accusations are baseless, we can understand his frustration, but there’s still no need for Jax to go off on a fan who was merely trying to make sure he was aware of what folks are saying out there.</p><p>Oh, and dude, don’t jinx yourself by saying you’re not going anywhere.</p><p>Very few reality shows remain on the air past ten years without major cast retooling, and it’s very rare that the stars from such franchises retain anything resembling real fame after their series come to an end.</p><p>Snooki is the exception, not the rule, ya dig?</p><p><a href=#>Watch Vanderpump Rules online</a> for more bad behavior from Jax and company.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>37 Classic Vanderpump Rules Moments in GIFs</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pwX2WEcLbAsWStmamhvLN5wpqsoKCkYrCpscCtoKefXaS7bq7RoqutmZ6ueqSt0a2uq6GXncFurcaaoKdn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
