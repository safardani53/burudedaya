An eyewitness told the news outlet that the former <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>What I Like About You</a> star waved down a car early Sunday, March 19, without any clothes on and revealed she was coming down from a psychiatric episode. She was then taken to a nearby police station where it was reportedly decided she needed to be placed on a 5150 hold. Those holds typically last 72 hours, but can extend based on a patient’s needs. At this time, she remains in a facility’s care, and will “likely continue to receive care for several days”, according to TMZ.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Amanda-Bynes-psychiatric-hold-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Sources further told TMZ that it didn’t appear Amanda was hurt at all during the incident, but obviously, things could have been a lot worse “given the area where she was found”. <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> reached out to both Amanda’s rep and lawyer, who have yet to comment on the situation.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Interestingly, this Wednesday, March 22, would have marked the one-year anniversary of Amanda’s 9-year conservatorship <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>being terminated</a>. The actress’ mom became her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>conservator in 2013</a>, when Amanda was having problems with her mental health and diagnosed with bipolar disorder. After a few scary incidents, including an instance when Amanda set her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>neighbor’s driveway on fire</a>, she went away for treatment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Amanda-Bynes-psychiatric-hold-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>After Amanda’s conservatorship ended in March 2022, she shared the following statement with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>&nbsp;magazine: “Following today’s decision by the judge to terminate my conservatorship, I would like to thank my fans for their love and well wishes during this time. I would also like to thank my lawyer and my parents for their support over the last nine years. <span>In the last several years, I have been working hard to improve my health so that I can live and work independently, and I will continue to prioritize my well-being in this next chapter,” she continued. “I am excited about my upcoming endeavors — including my fragrance line — and look forward to sharing more when I can.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Amanda was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>scheduled to attend 90s Con</a> in Connecticut this past weekend, but <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>she canceled on Friday</a>, March 17, due to illness.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH10e5FpZpqlkaOxonnBsqWeq12lwLqvx6KYraqZmHqpu8udZKeZm5qxcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
