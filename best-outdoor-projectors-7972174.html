Forget the drive-in, create an outdoor movie night right at home — it’s easier than you might think. The days of large, complicated projector setups are over. With WiFi and Bluetooth technology, many outdoor projectors are cordless, portable, and easy to use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tested 9 projectors for a total of 63 hours to evaluate the overall user experience and performance of each. After observing each projector’s setup and design along with the audio and video quality, we narrowed down our final recommendations.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Prep that popcorn and read on for our top picks for outdoor projectors.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-nebula-by-anker-solar-portable-1080p-smart-projector></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nebula by Anker Solar Portable Projector</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Nebula Solar Portable 1080p Smart Projector" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/nHNXNKK5lDvDsjPsraTxw7U3n4M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Nebula-Solar-Portable-1080p-Smart-Projector-3b7900237d1c4da69e691e78f249e420.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Image Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Sound Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Connectivity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>The setup was straightforward and seamless using a Google account and an Android phone.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The auto-focus feature is a helpful design element.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The included battery lasted us for the length of a full movie without needing to be recharged.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our best overall pick is this portable projector from Anker. Setup was a breeze with an existing Google account and Android phone. This outdoor projector operates on Android TV9 software, and in mere minutes we were connected and able to download various apps and streaming platforms. We found this projector easy to use for Android users, and the included remote was user-friendly as well. With an additional app, you can also use the projector with Netflix and any Apple device.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This projector’s design is sleek and portable — ideal for travel. We love that it’s battery-powered and can be used anywhere. Campfire movie night, anyone? It has 3 hours of battery life and we were able to watch a full movie without needing to recharge the battery. However, the included USB-C cord was very short, and we needed to use an extension cord when plugging it in during testing.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This projector yielded bright, clear, and sharp images. We were impressed with the auto-focus feature and found the picture quality great from all angles. The built-in speakers sounded great during testing from various positions and distances. With the speakers built onto the back of this projector, we found the best audio was experienced when sitting behind it. Overall, the volume levels were spot on for a delightful movie-watching experience.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another great feature is the diverse connectivity options with this outdoor projector. You can use WiFi, Bluetooth, USB-C, USB, Wi-Fi, Chromecast, and HDMI. This projector is a little more expensive than the median price of others we tested, but the ease of use, versatility, and portability make it an all-around winner.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Resolution: </strong>1920 x 1080<strong> </strong>| <strong>Brightness: </strong>400 ANSI lumens |<strong> Connectivity: </strong>HDMI, USB, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Chromecast<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size: </strong>7.56 x 7.57 x 2.15 inches</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="Anker Nebula Solar Portable 1080p Projector on ground with all pieces displayed" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/KhNqzkniGN49fOaZ0rUduVbb7Dc=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-outdoor-projectors-test-anker-nebula-solar-tammy-gardini-02-6c7189228070422bb5ece4c86f21bd07.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Tammy Gardini</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="Anker Nebula Solar Portable 1080p Projector set up on ground pointing at screen" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ezr8f1kC7IcyYh39TpF6WvtC7ZU=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-outdoor-projectors-test-anker-nebula-solar-tammy-gardini-03-d77bb0c95b5b450db15edc7fc39adcc4.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Tammy Gardini</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-dr-j-native-5g-bluetooth-projector-with-screen></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dr. J Bluetooth Projector</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon DR.

This Dr. J Bluetooth Projector is the most affordable one we tested and outperformed several other more expensive models. We found the setup straightforward and simple and completed it in less than 30 minutes. We had minor difficulty finding the best angle but with an added wedge placed under the projector we were able to get it just right. The included cord is about 6 feet long so we supplemented it with an extension cord for outdoor use.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The image quality was clear and bright with vibrant colors. (We experienced the best image quality with this projector after sundown with minimal additional outdoor lighting.) The best view was right in front of the projector, with the image quality degrading only slightly from very sharp angles. We found the best sound quality in pairing this projector with a Bluetooth speaker, though the built-in speakers will do just fine in a pinch. We were able to connect in multiple ways on various devices using an HDMI input, AV cord, and USB drive. It’s also enabled for WiFi and 3.5mm input for audio. All in all, this is a basic and effective projector at a great price.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Resolution: </strong>1920 x 1080<strong> </strong>| <strong>Brightness: </strong>13,000 lumens |<strong> Connectivity: </strong>Bluetooth 5.1, 5G Wi-Fi, HDMI, USB, AV, 3.5mm audio<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size:</strong> 12.13 x 8.9 x 6.46 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-anker-nebula-cosmos-laser-4k-projector></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Anker Laser 4K Projector</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Anker Nebula Cosmos Laser 4K Projector" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/X3DmDzfyKxHGL3-Uk-erWPUKdMY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/anker-nebula-cosmos-laser-4k-projector-c332bb6d27c54b8982b917b7cd18f20a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Image Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Sound Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Connectivity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2><li readability=0><p>The built-in handle makes carrying and maneuvering this projector easier than other models we tested.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The image quality from this projector was incredible from every angle and even on various surfaces.</p></li><li readability=2><p>The remote has four preset buttons for YouTube, Disney+, Amazon Prime, and Netflix.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking to invest in a high-quality projector that delivers impeccable 4K image quality, this one from Anker is the ticket. Setup was streamlined and easy during testing using the Google Play store to download all the desired apps and platforms. All we needed was a Gmail account to get started. The projector comes fully assembled and ready to go, so most of our setup time was dedicated to selecting, downloading, and logging into apps, which was very easy. The remote includes convenient presets for Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube, and Disney+. Plus, the compact size and built-in handle make for extra portability and maneuvering. We were able to try it all around the house before setting it up outside. However, the cord on this projector is only about 4 feet long, so we needed to supplement with an extension cord of our own.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">What really blew us away was the image quality of this projector. The auto-focus feature provided impressive clarity when we tried projecting onto other surfaces like the back of a couch and curtains. In 4k, the images were bright and the colors were nicely saturated. We were able to enjoy great image quality even at dusk and with occasional backlighting.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tried viewing from various vantage points during testing and were pleased with the great video quality at every angle. The built-in speakers sounded great for a 10 to 15-foot radius around the projector. This projector also has many different options for playback: We connected it to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB, HDMI, Chromecast, Android TV, and screen mirroring — and they all worked great. The price tag is hefty but worth it for the cinephile longing to create their own personal outdoor movie theater.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Resolution:</strong> 3840 x 2160 |<strong> Brightness: </strong>2,400 lumens | <strong>Connectivity: </strong>USB, HDMI, Aux, AC-In, Bluetooth, WiFi | <strong>Size: </strong>10.4 x 8.7 x 6.5 inches</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Jennifer May</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-easiest-setup-epson-epiqvision-mini-ef12-projector></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Easiest Setup</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Epson Mini EF12 Projector</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Epson EpiqVision Mini EF12 Projector" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/hCmmTvDyZMSdCYn9sKCxIyNx5DU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/epson-epiqvision-mini-ef12-projector-1c37f7e16a4e4cb08cd44acfa9524a0f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Image Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Sound Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Connectivity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=-1><p>This projector had the fastest setup time — only about 8.5 minutes during testing.</p></li><li readability=0><p>The remote control that comes with the projector was easy to use and gave us access to all major functions.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With this projector from Epson, we had the fastest and easiest setup of all the projectors we tested. We went from unboxing to home screen in just 8 minutes and 30 seconds. The overall setup is very intuitive with easy-to-follow instructions. This projector has an auto-focus feature and once we turned it on, everything looked super sharp immediately. This projector offered a manual setup or “Google quick set up” and we opted for the latter which paired our phone to the projector. We were able to connect via WiFi and then select all our desired compatible apps and sync via a Google account. The projector was ready in 5 minutes and it took just a few more minutes to finish installing 10 apps in the background.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The included remote was more robust than others we tested with access to features like input select, auto keystone, the settings menu, and voice control. The projector natively runs on Android TV, allowing access to a wide range of apps in the Google Play store. Unfortunately, like other Android TV devices, the Netflix app is not supported. However, we were able to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>stream Netflix</a> from a laptop via HDMI.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This projector is bright enough to deal with evening ambient light and even the light from street lights. It performs best during sunset and dusk and delivers rich and vibrant colors. The sound quality of the internal speakers impressed us with a range of 20 to 30 feet. We only wish it had a carrying case to transport it indoors to outdoors while protecting the lens. If you want to skip any of the fuss and get straight to streaming, this projector is for you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Resolution: </strong>1920 x 1080 | <strong>Brightness: </strong>1,000 lumens | <strong>Connectivity: </strong>WiFi, Bluetooth, USB, HDMI, 3.5mm audio jack | <strong>Size:</strong> 6.89 x 6.89 x 5.04 inches</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-5 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="all components included in box of Epson EpiqVision Mini EF12 Smart Streaming Laser Projector" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/aBU6G7QhnoCPFOS5wal5u5gREco=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-outdoor-projectors-test-epson-ef12-rafa-soriano-2-03287c4a27e94df0a447864dc4f5af43.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Rafa Soriano</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2566 data-sizes=750px alt="screen of the Epson EpiqVision Mini EF12 Smart Streaming Laser Projector set up outside" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/l7I4Q1XhSEqiq5OVMUHPdFqfbVs=/fit-in/1500x2566/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-outdoor-projectors-test-epson-ef12-rafa-soriano-11-0f4506548f2242e0bd4734075e640931.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Rafa Soriano</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-gaming-samsung-the-freestyle-gen-2-with-gaming-hub-projector></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Gaming</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Samsung The Freestyle Gen 2</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Best Buy Samsung The Freestyle Gen 2 with Gaming Hub Projector" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/A2Se29D_-myR4latnsKb9HBDhJE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Samsung-The-Freestyle-Gen-2-with-Gaming-Hub-Projector-66bcc5b6110f4adea8a8447aa2b3b6c9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Best Buy</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Image Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Sound Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Connectivity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>The built-in apps are user-friendly and easy to navigate.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The battery remained at full charge after watching an entire movie.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It’s compact and easy to transport.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Now you can bring your gaming set up outdoors. This projector from Samsung includes a gaming hub so you can stream all your games without plugging in your console. During testing, we found the setup very simple and straightforward, and the built-in apps user-friendly and easy to navigate. Those familiar with Samsung TVs or devices will find the process very streamlined. This projector delivered great picture quality throughout our tests. The picture looked best in darker environments and from directly in front of the projector.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tested out the front projection option, but this projector offers rear and ceiling projection too. We were impressed with the sound quality of the built-in speakers and felt they worked great outdoors; we amplified our audio experience even more by connecting via Bluetooth to external speakers. The compact size is ideal for traveling or bringing your gaming setup to a friend’s backyard.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The battery life on this projector also won us over. Even though the included cord was too short for outdoor use, we were able to watch a full movie using the internal battery with no issues. Afterward, it was still at full charge.

We found connectivity via HDMI input fairly seamless but had issues connecting to an external audio source when screen mirroring. Also, the internal apps on the projector did not perform well, and an additional app was required to stream Netflix.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"><strong>BenQ GS50 1080p Wireless Outdoor Projector</strong></a>: This $799 projector’s small profile makes it easy to pack for travel.

Setup was the toughest part for us. Navigating the features and determining the correct distance and sizing was not intuitive. This projector operates on Android TV, which worked great for streaming many of the desired platforms, except Netflix. We also had some issues with Bluetooth connectivity and needed to reset the focus anytime someone walked in front of the projector.</li><li><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim"><strong>KODAK Luma 350 Portable Smart Projector w/Luma App</strong></a>: This $350 projector is lightweight and very portable.

We also experienced connectivity issues with the companion app, making it difficult to control the projector.&nbsp;</li></ul><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Kimberly Souza</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-before-buying-a-outdoor-movie-projector></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider Before Buying a Outdoor Movie Projector</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Setup and Environment</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“When projecting outdoors, how dark an image can get is dictated by mother nature and any light pollution for that particular area,” advises Bill Ng, an audio and video technician for Skyline Drive-In NYC.

Another major part of the setup during testing was creating and logging into accounts to download various apps. If you have a Google account, a projector like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Epson EpiqVision Mini EF12 Smart Streaming Laser Projector</a> is a great choice for a streamlined setup since it includes Android TV and features a quick Google setup option.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Design and Connectivity</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Choose a projector with design elements that support your desired viewing experience. If you’re hoping to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>stream movies</a> while camping, a portable and battery-powered projector would be the best option. Decide if front projection, rear projection, or the option to choose between the two is important to you. It’s also important to consider the type of content you want to enjoy with your projector and what connectivity options you will require. Many projectors are equipped to download and stream apps. Some offer varied inputs like HDMI, USB, Bluetooth, or screen mirroring as other ways to connect. Also, consider if external speakers are something you want to integrate into your outdoor cinema and what connectivity will be required.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Image and Sound Quality</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Image and sound quality are some of the most important factors to consider with outdoor movie projectors.

He recommends at least 10,000 lumens (or 4167 ANSI lumen) for an outside audience. Light and noise pollution will always be something to contend with when enjoying any movie outdoors, so aim for a more secluded, dark environment to get the most out of your projector.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Price</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Projectors can cost a pretty penny, but there are many affordable options that will deliver a high-quality experience.
