They're just like us! Except not really, since they can afford to always smell their best, even on the hottest, most disgusting days.</p><p>Although you expect every famous person to smell like an expensive bottle of perfume, that's not always the case. From cigarettes to baby wipes, see what your fave celebs' unique, quirky scents are like. Including, of course, the person we've all been wondering about, Post Malone. What does he smell like?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Brad Pitt</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Contrary to tabloid rumors that he smells like "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a dog</a>" (really, National Enquirer?), Brad actually smells <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">like sandalwood</a>, according to Jennifer Lawrence.</p><p>"Brad Pitt smells amazing, like nothing I've ever smelled," Jennifer's Oscar date told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today</a>. "Eventually we ask what cologne he's wearing and he tells us, 'I don't wear cologne, it's just my musk I guess.' I have to choose not to believe him because it would just be unfair to mankind."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jennifer Lawrence</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>And speaking of Jennifer, she says she smells like booze, which we totally believe. "My signature scent probably is already red wine,” she told Glamour. "I’m sure it’s always seeping from my pores. I smell like a cabernet.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Michelle Obama</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>According to Chrissy Teigen, the former first lady smells <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"like orchids." </a>A writer who was lucky enough to bask in Michelle's presence earlier this year confirmed it, too. "Michelle Obama smells amazing," she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>. "I could never put my finger on it, but when she hugged me with her incredibly toned arms, the first thing I thought was holy s--t Michelle Obama is giving me a hug, and secondly, wow she smells so good."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Kanye West</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Although you'd think Kanye would be vain enough to simply wallow in his own musk, according to Kim Kardashian, he actually smells of cold, hard cash. "I can’t explain it, but like a rich person," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cut</a>. "Like … money, I don’t know! He smells like what you think a really expensive, Saint Laurent fragrance campaign would be."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Oprah</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Although Tina Fey's character in 30 Rock once joked that Oprah smelled like "rosewater and warm laundry," the reality is that she's actually an ethereal being who smells like rare, precious stones. "She smelled wonderful," James Marsden said on Conan. "She smelled like diamonds.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Harry Styles</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>When Harry appeared on Carpool Karaoke in 2018, host James Corden revealed that the former One Directioner smelled like " summer in a bowl." He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">added</a>, "It’s like the bottom of your bag when you get back from the beach." How...poetic?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Beyoncé</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Most people think Queen Bey smells like angels and cocoa butter, and according to model Winnie Harlow, they aren't that far off the mark.

Oo, we were close!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ezra Miller</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The eccentric actor isn't big on personal hygiene or dousing himself in cologne. In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ profile</a> piece about him, the writer revealed he smelled "like cigarettes and not deodorant." Huh.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Taylor Swift</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Back in 2010, David Letterman told her she smelled like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"expensive wood</a>" — whatever that means. However, earlier this year, a BBC reporter actually told her she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">needed to take a shower.</a> I guess this means she smells like old trees? Well, she did grow up on a Christmas tree farm.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Post Malone</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>There are at least a few <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">threads on reddit</a> with people speculating on what the heavily tattooed rap artist smells like. The comments are colorful but not very kind. "He looks like he smells like the inside of Walter White's camper," suggests one user, while another says, "He looks look like he smells like a wet basement."</p><p>There was even a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hoax article</a> circulating in September that said his manager quit over his rankness, describing the smell as resembling "expired milk and moldy cheese." Scuze me, just gotta barf real quick.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Post Malone</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>However, this never actually happened — hence the word hoax — and a few people who've met Post say he smells fine. Though the "White Iverson" artist admits he doesn't really do deodorant, he insists the ladies enjoy his "natural musk."</p><p>"I smell good. I smell like a normal person," he wrote on a Facebook thread while participating in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GQ's "Actually Me" video series</a>. "But I don't smell bad, that's a common misconception. And I did a poll with people around town and the consensus is that I don't smell." While that study wouldn't stand up to scientific scrutiny, I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ryan Gosling</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>No surprise here, but our boyfriend Ryan Gosling smells pretty darn good.

"It’s a sweet citrus, but it changes during the day," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a>. "I think in the morning… It’s very sweet and citrusy in the morning. It mellows by the afternoon into…more of a burnt, woody — no, I shouldn’t say that." Too late.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Prince</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The late musician's smell was so iconic, people who knew him said they could always smell him coming.

And you knew when he was there because you'd turn around and go, 'Holy $#!*, I smell Prince.'
