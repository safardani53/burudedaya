Brooooo like what is this. In the middle of Italy," he apparently wrote.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000739710522.jpg><p>However, Younes was not keen to join in the roast, as he clapped back: "Doesn't matter to me as long as she's happy. PS: I ain't your bro."</p><p>Then, he added a screenshot of the conversation to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his Instagram story</a>&nbsp;for his fans.</p><p>The 28-year-old then added the message, "Keep the same energy you had about me publicly, privately", as he took fire at Scott's internet behavior.</p><h2>'UNCOMFORTABLE'</h2><p>A source recently revealed that "Scott has found [Kourtney and Travis's] <a href=#>over-the-top makeout sessions</a> to be "uncomfortable," to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Us Weekly.</a></p><p>“Of course, it’s awkward for Scott. He doesn’t take the time to watch the full episodes and why should he? He doesn’t need to," they explained.</p><p>"That’s the last thing he wants to do, relive the awkward moments of him, Travis, and Kourtney. He lived through it already.”</p><p>The informant continued: "He showed up and gave the cameras what they wanted, and at the end of the day, he’s getting a nice paycheck.”</p><p>Although Scott has insisted that he feels happy for the newlyweds, the insider admitted that the transition has still been difficult.</p><p>“He turns away any time he’s around them and they’re making out. It’s embarrassing and Travis and Kourtney act like no one’s in the room whenever they’re together.</p><p>"Scott’s all about PDA but would never put any of his exes in such an awkward position," they added.</p><h2>SCOTT BEING SCOTT</h2><p>Scott didn't miss his opportunity to <a href=#>throw shade in a recent episode</a> of the Kardashians.</p><p>Kourtney's sister&nbsp;<a href=#>Khloe Kardashian</a>, 37, visits Scott to cheer him up after he and his kids were left out of Kourtney's engagement party to Travis.</p><p>She asks him how he's been, referring to news of the engagement.</p><p>Scott responds that he'll always love Kourtney but then continues stating, "I wasn't that caught off guard. I thought they'd already been married the way that she was talking."</p><p>"So it wasn't crazy", he admits then adds, "Thank God, because at another time in my life, if I would have heard that, life would've been over for me".</p><p>It's at this point that Scott's jealous nature starts to rear its ugly head.</p><p>"It does give me a lot of relief that she's happy, somebody else is taking care of her."</p><p>In a confessional Scott discloses that he always felt like it was "[his] fault] for breaking up [their] family" and that he had the responsibility to "be there for [Kourtney] and take care of her".</p><p>He proceeds to say that "even though we weren't together, I just felt that guilt. So it was a lot to handle."</p><p>Scott then starts to reveal the true intention of his "thoughtfulness".</p><p>"I...in a selfish way feel like a lot has kinda been lifted off of me. I think in the end...it's a good thing. I couldn't do the job of being with her."</p><p>He then lets out a sigh of relief and states that he "salutes Travis" because "he's in for a lot of work".</p><p>Khloe questions "what do you mean? Like with the whole family?'</p><p>Scott replies, fully doubling down on his jealously induced shade-throwing now: "No, the family's the best part. Kourtney is not the simplest when it comes to...everything."</p><p>Khloe in her own confessional states, "This is just him being snarky".</p><p>She continues: "He's acting out...it's so clear, it's so transparent. But if Kourtney was such as problem...why would he want to be with her for so many years?"</p><h2>HATERS GONNA HATE</h2><p>Scott <a href=#>took a swipe at the entire Kardashian clan</a> when attempting to mend a bridge with <a href=#>Kendall Jenner</a>, 26.</p><p>The two sat down to talk and Kendall openly admitted that "[she] hasn't spoken to [Scott] since everything went down".</p><p>Scott acknowledges that the fight might have been their "first argument" since they've known each other.</p><p>Kendall tells him that she's "always been his supporter and [that she] always will be" and that she was trying to apologize but the situation is still very fresh.</p><p>"The beginning of any sort of change in a family is just a difficult, awkward time," she says.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More On The Sun">Read More On The Sun</h2><p>With things squared, Scott lets it be known what he thinks of Kendall compared to the rest of her family.</p><p>"I'm telling you, you're the most normal person in the family... everybody's dealing with something".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000676405969.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/06/NINTCHDBPICT000737591511.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2htZWmAcYSYaKqcp6SpeqW10qKapGWjpby1wMSdZJ2ZpJp6uLXToWShp6Rir627zZ2cZp%2Bilq%2B0ecGuq61n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
