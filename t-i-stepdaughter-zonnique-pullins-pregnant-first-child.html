It's weird!"</p><p>The mom-to-be is five-months-along and said her pregnancy has been so far "really easy."</p><p>The singer said: "With it being my first time being pregnant, I had so many expectations and was thinking, 'Oh, it's going to be really hard.'</p><p>"I never really had morning sickness."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000600210718.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000600210639.jpg><p>However going to doctors appointments during the pandemic has been challenging.</p><p>She explained: "It really sucks being pregnant during the coronavirus.</p><p>"At first, I'm like, 'This is the perfect time, like everybody is locked in. I don't have to worry about going out. So if I want to hide it for however long, I can hide.'</p><p>"But when it comes to going to doctor's appointments, I go to all of them by myself. I ask every single time, 'Can I bring my boyfriend?' And&nbsp;they're like, 'No, only you can come.'</p><p>"That's been the worst part. I'm hoping by the time I'm ready to have the baby it will be over with.</p><p>"But I'm sure it won't be, so I'll be in there with one person, most likely.

So I was kind of sad at first, and my boyfriend was really excited from the jump. He was like, 'You know it's whatever you want to do.'</p><p>"I was calling my cousin, and they were laughing at me because they already knew&nbsp;that I didn't want to have a baby&nbsp;anytime soon.</p><p>"I was like, 'Why are you guys laughing?' And I'm just crying and stuff."</p><p>"But after a while, I'm like, 'Now I feel like I can do this. It's something that will mature me and change me in a great way.' I'm trying to wrap my head around it, and now we are here."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000589897824.jpg><p>Zonnique told her stepfather <a href=#>T.I.</a> she was expecting for the first time on the premiere episode of her new talk show The Mix.</p><p>&nbsp;T.I. is married to her mother&nbsp;Tameka "Tiny" Harris.</p><p>She revealed: "I felt like it may be a little funny to get his reaction.</p><p>"He can't get mad or anything. Even my real dad [Zonnie Pullins], I just told him last week, to be honest. You're&nbsp;always your dad's little princess. So, I just wasn't sure how he'd feel."</p><p>She added she also still has yet to share the news with about half of her family.</p><p>"That's the crazy part. It's not even&nbsp;the world that I've been not telling.</p><p>"All my fans are like, 'Oh, all you have to do is say yes.' But half of my family I still haven't gotten around to calling.</p><p>"Some of my sisters still don't know.
