The Power star looked absolutely stunning in a skin-tight metallic mini-dress with a chest cutout. She headed to&nbsp; the Premier Nightclub at Atlantic City’s Borgata which hosted a party for her in June 29. A smiling La La posed next to a cake in her honor with black icing and orange sugary flames coming out of the sides, which <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>you can see here</a>.&nbsp; In another photo she was seen with at least a dozen girlfriends present to help her celebrate her big night.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>La La’s actual birthday was on June 25, the same day that the photos of Carmelo lying next to Sara on a yacht dropped so that was a really lousy way for her have a happy day. He did <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>send her birthday wishes</a> from afar, posting and Instagram pic of her and writing ‘“Your heart is full of love and affection. Your hands are always caring. I am lucky to have you as my wife. HAPPY BORN DAY QUEEN I LOVE YOU @lala.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>After the photo in France dropped, the NBA star issued<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> a powerful denial</a> that anything was going on, claiming he was on a business trip with married friends when the pic was taken. In a video he gave to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ sports</a> on June 26 he said “I’m really only addressing this for my family,” he said at the start of the clip referring to La La and their son<strong>&nbsp;Kiyan Carmelo Anthony</strong>, 12, adding “Keep my family out this, man.” In the pic, there was no touching or PDA going on as the two were just lying next to each other.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I’m over here trying to do a business retreat. I’m over here trying to have a good time,” he continued, adding that he was on a boat with some married pals. He said “Y’all exposing somebody’s wife, c’mon! Leave that alone, that ain’t cool. Now I gotta deal with it with my son, I gotta deal with that with my wife. That’s ain’t cool man,” he continued, even though several websites claimed that Sara isn’t married.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“The only reason I’m addressing this is cause it’s affecting my family now. And y’all got me out here looking crazy. Usually I wouldn’t address this but I had to address this. I can’t let this one slide cause this sh*t ain’t cool no more. Peace.” he concluded. The message didn’t seem to help things at home, as the following day&nbsp; La La posted then deleted an Instagram pic of a bullet being shot through a heart, showing that she was hurting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH13e5JpZqWZnJZ6orrToaansV2lrrPAyJ6qZpqZp8GpsMCyZJ%2BqmZq7pb%2BMnJirpZWhvG7FwJyfrWWdpLGmuI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
