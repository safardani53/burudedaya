Although she was only <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>married once</a>, she did have a couple of long-term relationships with other famous stars. Below is everything to know about Priscilla’s marriage to the “King of Rock and Roll” and her other romances!</p><h2>Her Marriage To Elvis Presley</h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>The red haired beauty was previously <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>married</a> to Elvis from 1967 until their <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>divorce</a> in 1973. Priscilla met the “Burning Love” hitmaker when she was just 14 years old and he was 24. At the time, Elvis was serving in the United States Army in Germany and they later reconnected in 1962 when she was 17, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>US Weekly</a>. It was not until 1966 that Elvis and Priscilla got <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>engaged</a> about seven years after meeting. “One day he showed me the ring and simply asked me to marry him,” she told Ladies Home Journal&nbsp;in 1972. “Even though we were perfectly content the way we were, at that time it wasn’t nice for people to live together.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>After they got married in Las Vegas, Elvis and Priscilla expanded their family and welcome their daughter, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lisa Marie Presley</strong></a>, in 1968. Sadly, the celebrity couple’s marriage did not last and the&nbsp;Elvis and Me author filed for divorce from the rocker in 1973. Recently, in March 2022, Priscilla opened up about <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her marriage</a> to Elvis during an interview while visiting the exhibit Elvis: Direct From Graceland, at the Bendigo Art Gallery in Australia (via <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Daily Mail</a>). “The beginning [of the marriage] was very difficult, but I knew what I was in for because I saw it at a very young age,” she said at the time. “That’s when I started not reading papers anymore or [magazines] in the grocery stores.” Elvis <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sadly died</a> in 1977 due to cardiac arrest and Priscilla has not remarried to this day. Their daughter Lisa Marie <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>died on January 12, 2023</a> at the age of 54 after going into cardiac arrest.</p><h2>Marco Garibaldi</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/priscilla-presley-marco-garibaldi-ss-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Priscilla’s longest relationship to date was with film producer&nbsp;<strong>Marco Garibaldi</strong>, 68. The duo met in 1984, about 11 years after her divorce from Elvis. Although Priscilla and Marco never got married, their relationship became even more serious in 1987 when they welcomed their son,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Navarone Garibaldi</strong></a>, 36. Marco and his then-love would remain together for over 20 years until they called it quits in 2006.</p><h2>Robert Kardashian</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/priscilla-presley-robert-kardashian-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Another iconic celebrity that the&nbsp;Dancing with The Stars&nbsp;alum dated was the late lawyer&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Robert Kardashian</strong></a>.

That was definitely his hope, his plan.” Another friend of the late businessman claimed that Robert told him that Priscilla was “terrific, but this guy Elvis doesn’t stop controlling her.” Robert allegedly told others close to him that Elvis didn’t want Priscilla to date other men “because they had Lisa Marie, and Elvis was very involved in that.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Michael Stone</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/priscilla-presley-michael-stone-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>After the&nbsp;Dallas&nbsp;star’s marriage to Elvis came to an end it wouldn’t be too long until Priscilla moved on and began dating&nbsp;<strong>Michael “Mike” Stone</strong>.
