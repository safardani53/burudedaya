The “Congratulations” artist turned heads while wearing skinny jeans and a cropped T-shirt in an April 2023 Instagram video promoting Raising Canes. He looked equally svelte in his “Chemical” music video, where he looked fly in his all-denim outfit. Fans will get another look at his weight loss journey when he performs as part of&nbsp;Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve with Ryan Seacrest&nbsp;on Sunday, December 31.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>While some fans shared concern about Post’s sudden weight loss, his father, <strong>Richard Post</strong>, cleared up any speculation about his son’s weight. “Healthiest he’s been in years [both] mentally and physically,” Richard wrote in a comment via Instagram in February 2023.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Post would later explain in April 2023 that the weight loss was due to him changing his diet, cutting back on drugs, and taking care of himself. “Dad Life kicked in,” he commented, referring to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the daughter</a> he and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his still-unnamed fiancé</a> welcomed in May 2022.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Lately, Post has had plenty of opportunities to show off how far he’s come with his weight loss, with plenty of public performances at award shows and more. He’ll close out 2023 with another epic performance on the&nbsp;New Year’s Rockin’ Eve&nbsp;broadcast.&nbsp; Take a look at the “Circles” artist’s weight-loss journey below.</p><h2>How Much Weight Did Post Malone Lose?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>During his August 2023 appearance on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Joe Rogan Experience</a>,&nbsp;Post said that he weighed 240 pounds at his heaviest, but he currently clocked in at 185, after his changes in diet. In February 2023, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a> reported that Post had previously gained weight for a movie role, but since the project was over, he was focused more on losing and keeping the weight off.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Post-Malone-Weight-Loss-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>The weight loss might also be part of Post taking care of his mental health. “I’m an ugly-ass motherfucker,” Post told GQ in a March 2020 feature about his multiple tattoos.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Post said that his desire to cover himself in ink “come(s) from a place of insecurity, to where I don’t like how I look. So, I’m going to put something cool on there so I can look at myself and say, ‘You look cool, kid,’ and have a modicum of self-confidence when it comes to my appearance.”</p><h2><strong>How Did Post Malone Lose Weight?</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>Following the online discussion of his weight loss in 2023, Post clarified how he could shed so many pounds.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>“I wanted to say that I’m not doing drugs,” Post wrote on April 27 while on tour in Europe. “I’ve had a lot of people ask me about my weight loss and, I’d suppose, [my] performance on stage. I’m having a lot of fun performing, and have never felt healthier. I guess ‘dad life’ kicked in and I decided to kick soda and start eating better so I can be around for a long time for this little angel.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Post said that he’s on the road to getting completely sober, saying that “next up is smokes and brews,” but he’s going to take his time (“I like to consider myself a patient man”).</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>TMZ reported that Post has been “adhering to a strict diet” and exercise regimen. His touring schedule may have also contributed to his weight loss. As of Spring 2023, Post was wrapping up a world tour, and while normally the constant irregularity of travel and disrupted schedules has an adverse effect on a performer’s health, TMZ reports that Post’s 90-minute sets are helping him stay fit.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>While Posty has credited cutting soda as part of the reason he has done so well, he said that he does let himself indulge on occasion. “Soda is so bad. It’s so good but so bad,” he told Joe Rogan. “[If] I had a great show, and you know what, I’m feeling a little bit naughty. I’m gonna have myself a Coke on ice.”</p><h2><strong>How Does Post Malone Feel About His Weight Loss?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Post-Malone-Weight-Loss-SS-embed-3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-18>Post seems to be in a better spot than ever. “My brain is in a super dope place,” he wrote in April 2023, after the online concern about his weight. “I’m the happiest I’ve been in a long time. If you’re having a hard time or need some love, I can say that you’re loved more than you know, and keep f***ing crushing it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>You too, Posty.
