The game continues until either the werewolves or the villagers win.</p><h2>What has been said about Werewolf?</h2><p><a href=#>Harry Kane</a> admitted that it is a good way to build the team chemistry and a large group of the squad get involved.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/bukayo-saka-england-celebrates-phil-781091177-1.jpg><p>Kane, 29, said: "There about 16 or 17 of us that play Wolf and it is a great way to kill some time. It also helps with team bonding.</p><p>And <a href=#>Manchester City star Kalvin Phillips </a>also revealed it's a game you can enjoy by just watching.</p><p>Phillips said: "It's definitely one you can watch as it's quite funny and even if I'm not around there, when they get somebody out. You can hear them cheering by the pool."</p><h2>When is England vs France?</h2><ul><li><a href=#>England vs France</a> takes place on <strong>Saturday, December 10.</strong></li><li>The match kicks off at <strong>7pm UK time</strong> and Al-Bayt Stadium plays host.</li><li>It will be shown LIVE on ITV 1 in but the entire action can also be live-streamed on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ITV X</a>, the mobile app which is available for download.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH9xgpdra2pwX6y1osCMoqpmr5Wnsri7y59knqaXoa6vsIycmKucXZyurrGMsKarpJRisLa8jGtna2pf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
