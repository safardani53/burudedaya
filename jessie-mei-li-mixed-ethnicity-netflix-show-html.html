Because her journey starts as “I’m no one, you know I’m just an outsider” to suddenly being like “no, this is where I belong.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Besides that, Mei Li also shared her experience of getting the role, remembering the audition process. She remembered looking through the audition script — and it surprised her to see that she had a mixed-race role up for&nbsp;grabs.</p><p>She said: “I was like, ‘Oh, I never get mixed race roles, it’s always one or the other, I never look enough of anything.’” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The actress was selected to play the role after the series’ casting team performed a worldwide search for the perfect candidate. “I think they got something like a thousand submissions. Hundreds of tapes and things like that so I thought I’m never going to get that,” Mei Li stated.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The series&nbsp;Shadow and Bone&nbsp;is a fantasy show&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">based</a>&nbsp;on Leigh Bardugo’s worldwide bestselling Grishaverse novels, scheduled to premiere on Netflix on April 23, 2021. The series' showrunner is Eric Heisserer and it has been produced in association with 21 Laps Entertainment.</p><p>Besides Mei Li, who portrays the lead role, the series stars several talented actors, including Ben Barnes, Freddy Carter, Amita Suman, Kit Young, and Archie Renaux. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Mei Li previously made her&nbsp;stage debut playing Claudia Casswell’s role in&nbsp;All About Eve&nbsp;at Noel Coward Theatre in February 2019. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She will also be seen&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">playing</a>&nbsp;the role of Lara Chung in the upcoming film&nbsp;Last Night in Soho, directed by the mercurial Edgar Wright.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2BytL%2FInmSmnZliuap5zKKvnpxdmsGpusicoK2xXaOytbLLoq9mq5ikxG%2B006aj</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
