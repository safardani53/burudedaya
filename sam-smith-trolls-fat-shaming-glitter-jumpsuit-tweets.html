Online trolls used Twitter to attack Sam and their weight after the “Unholy” singer wore a fabulous <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>glittery jumpsuit</a> to perform at Capital’s Jingle Bell Ball in London on Dec. 10. The jumpsuit was actually similar to one that <strong><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Harry Styles</a></strong>, 28, previously wore in concert. But while Harry was praised for his look, Sam was cruelly ridiculed and attacked.&nbsp;Luckily, Sam’s fans came to their defense and called out the “gross” body-shaming comments on Twitter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sam-smith-tour-sequined-jumpsuit-twitter-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>“<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">It’s actually gross constantly seeing people tear into Sam Smith for their appearance when there’s a lot of us, myself included, who have a similar body type to them.
