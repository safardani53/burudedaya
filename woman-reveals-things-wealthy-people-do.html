Take it from <a href=#>TikTok</a> user Bella Dane (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@spicybells</a>), who spends her days working at a fancy country club full of rich folks.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Now, though she doesn't have the time to worship them, she ogles once in a while and observes their behavior. As a result, Bella has noticed a few things that wealthy people always do that supposedly make them stand out from the average person. Read on to find out more, and stick around to hear what the internet has to say.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/NH6Jy2EGT/200x200/allison-degrushe-headshot-1-1632780540988.jpg><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This woman revealed things that wealthy people always do.</h2><p>On Aug. 16, 2023, Bella posted a video with a text overlay that reads: "Things I've noticed wealthy people do."</p><p>Bella explained that since she started working at a "very nice, expensive" country club, she's learned a lot about rich people and the "obvious" differences between old money and new money.</p><p>For starters, wealthy people always introduce themselves with their first and last names. According to Bella, the rich say their name with "a lot of pride and a nice, firm handshake." She added, "When you give the first impression that I'm important and my name is important, it kind of sets the tone for how people view you."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>The second thing Bella noticed is that wealthy people speak "slowly, confidently, and calmly." She said this isn't true all the time, but noted that their speech is typically much slower than the average person's.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"They're not rushing to get through a conversation or need to say something," Bella continued. "Most of them seem to be really good listeners in a conversation. They're not thinking about what they're going to say next. They're genuinely just presently listening to what the other person is saying."</p><p>Bella also discovered that the wealthy don't wear clothes or accessories with brand logos.</p><p>"Money talks, but wealth is silent," Bella stated. "When I see a woman walk in [wearing] really high quality, really well-made clothing, very stylish pieces, and there's no logo or brand on anything, I know she's richer than everyone else."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>A few other things she noticed is that wealthy people have really refined palettes — some still order snacks like chips and queso, but they are quite knowledgeable about high-end food and alcohol. And last but not least, Bella said that rich people are never on their phones when they walk into a room.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I used to think this was just, like, a coincidence, but after a while of working there, I was like, they're definitely making sure that they're prepared and put together before they enter the room," Bella said. "They look around the room, scan the room, they smile. And they're always extremely interactive with the bartenders and the staff."</p><p>In the end, Bella claimed that the "really, really" wealthy people are "always nice."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The viral video, which has amassed 7.7 million views, racked in thousands of comments from fellow TikTokers wanting to prove Bella wrong: "You say first and last name at a country club to let people know which family (aka membership) you're in — that's all," one person wrote.</p><p>"You say your first and last name at a country club for identification," another TikTok user said, adding that rich people "speak slowly because they've never had to rush in their lives." OK, tea!</p><p>A third TikTok user pointed out, "They don’t look at their phone when entering as it is rude to be on the phone in these situations... so there's that." Very true, even for us average folks!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLyurc1mqZ6ulZa5tHnToaCnn6NixKaty62fsmWgmryxuMRmm6g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
