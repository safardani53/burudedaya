The gorgeous model hit the runway&nbsp;in a plaid look, featuring a purple plaid bra and panties, along with a red plain backpack and giant, caped green coat. &nbsp;The look put Gigi’s incredible figure on display, and she strutted like a fierce queen as she showed off the sexy ensemble.&nbsp;Then, for her second time down the runway, she wore&nbsp;skintight pants and a matching crop top ensemble, which was part of the brand’s new line with Mary Lou Katrantzou.&nbsp;Gigi’s look also included a MASSIVE parachute-like structure on her back, as opposed to wings like the models usually wear.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>During the show, Gigi had a huge smile on her face, and looked so thrilled to be walking in the VS show once again.

Plus,&nbsp;<strong>Behati Prinsloo, Candice Swanepoel, Elsa Hosk,</strong> who’s wearing the Fantasy Bra,&nbsp;<strong>Adriana Lima</strong> and more also returned for another strut on the runway. In addition to the models, the show also included performances from some of the biggest stars in music, like&nbsp;<strong>Shawn Mendes, Rita Ora, The Chainsmokers, Halsey, Kelsea Ballerini</strong> and more!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/gigi-hadid-vs-show-embed-02.jpg alt="gigi hadid vs fashion show" width=800 height=500 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>While we’ll have to rely on photos from the show to see what went down for now, we’ll get to see the whole thing in full when it airs on ABC on Dec. 2 at 10:00 p.m. How are we supposed to binge on holiday food with this on our radars?!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWloZH5ye49xZqChl556qa3DoptmqqWjxKLFjK%2BqZp6RqLWqu81mqqGnp2J%2FcX2XZqOippeav6qxjKmfqKyfqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
