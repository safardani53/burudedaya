I absolutely LOVE airports. Time zones don’t exist, and I find that magical. Also, when I fly, I always order tomato juice with ice. I do not drink this anywhere else except in the sky.</p><p>2. I drink iced coffee year round. I’m not a quitter.</p><p>3. I was a college cheerleader at Syracuse University. It was the classic “go with a friend to tryouts so they won’t be alone,” and then I made the squad and she didn’t. Also, in 8th grade, I was voted Most Valuable Cheerleader.</p><p>4. I’m an extroverted introvert. Meaning while I love interacting with people, I REALLY love sitting on my couch with my husband and dogs and no one else.</p><p>5. I dated the same guy all throughout high school and am still very good friends with him.</p><p>6. I knew <a href=#><strong>Colin [Donnell]</strong></a> was the one when <a href=#>we took a cross country road trip</a> together and ended up liking each other MORE.</p><p>7. I am deathly allergic to carrots.</p><p>8. I can answer any trivia question about Full House&nbsp;that exists.</p><p>9. I was the original Sharpay Evans in the stage premiere of High School Musical.</p><p>10. I still love the 80s TV show Kids Incorporated and routinely watch episodes on YouTube.</p><p>11. I geek out way more meeting authors than I do famous actors.</p><p>12. I can guess the house they choose on House Hunters correctly 98 percent of the time. No exaggeration.</p><p>13. I LOVE beauty products — face, hair, skin. I’m obsessed.</p><p>14. I played the clarinet for 8 years and because of that, I’m a great sight reader.</p><p>15. I ran track in high school and was competitive in the 100 meter hurdles.</p><p>16. For different musicals, I’ve had to learn how to roller skate, play basketball, twirl a baton and speak in about five different accents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Patti-Murin-Chicago-Med-25-Things-You-Dont-Know-About-Me.jpg><p>17. I hated seeing blood on TV until I started working on <a href=#>Chicago Med</a>. Now it’s very difficult to gross me out.</p><p>18. I can only watch really scary movies after I’ve had a few drinks.</p><p>19. My very first job was working at McDonald’s and to be honest, it’s still one of my absolute favorite fast food restaurants.</p><p>20. I crashed my first car into a tree. I was totally fine, but the tree was not.</p><p>21. My favorite app is Zillow. Don’t tell me your address or I will immediately find out how much you paid for your house.</p><p>22. In first grade, we were studying the letter “C” and I raised my hand and said my mom was having a baby that we were naming Cheryl. This was a complete and total lie.</p><p>23. Also in first grade, my teacher moved my desk away from everyone else’s because I was too much of a “social butterfly.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>24. I started learning to read when I was 3 years old.</p><p>25. I absolutely love Barbie … as in, the doll.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapmaSptm651Kugp2Vianq1tMinnqxlqaTCbrDOp6tmo56kxG6twaisrWWdmnqpu9ZmoGajnprEbq%2FOpaCnZZSku6%2Bxy6VksJmjYsGpsYyopZ5n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
