He feels like she faked it for seven months.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>The insider explains that Josh “didn’t see the split coming” and felt completely blindsided.</p><p>Panter’s pain was reportedly exacerbated by the fact that Mackenzie had gotten close to his entire family.</p><p>“When Ryan got out of prison, she dropped him and his family,” says the source.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“They went to eat with some good friends and she was affectionate and happy with Josh throughout the night like nothing was wrong.”</p><p>Obviously, we don’t know if Mackenzie’s decision to dump Josh had anything to do with Ryan getting out of prison.</p><p>The timing is certainly interesting, but we doubt that Mackenzie has any real interest in getting back together with her estranged husband.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>After all, the reason Edwards was locked up was that he’d gone on a bender and spent several days terrorizing Standifer and her kids.</p><p>At one point, <a href=#>Ryan trashed Mackenzie’s house</a> so badly that she was forced to move.</p><p>That’s generally not the kind of behavior that makes a woman miss her ex.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Then again, we didn’t think <a href=#>Maci Bookout would ever forgive Ryan Edwards</a>, and these days, she’s his biggest supporter!</p><p>The dude is clearly in possession of some sort of magic that only works on baby mamas and judges!</p><p>Hopefully, this time, he’ll realize how lucky he’s been and actually work to turn his life around.</p><p>But even if Ryan gets sober and becomes a model citizen, Mackenzie still shouldn’t forgive him.</p><p>The man has traumatized her kids quite enough already.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WGcLnAnKKepqqesm6%2F05qlnaGWmr9usMidZKyglWK%2Fpq3LpbBmnKWivW60xKtkm6epm7%2Bqsc2dZK2glWKxosWMrZ%2BarF2nxqK6jJ6bsJmimcBus86tZKitpGK8p3nPq6Csp55k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
