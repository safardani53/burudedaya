Social media users can’t look away after <a href=#><strong>Kumail Nanjiani</strong> </a>debuted his shredded body via Instagram.</p><p>“I never thought I’d be one of those people who would post a thirsty shirtless, but I’ve worked way too hard for way too long so here we are,” the 41-year-old actor wrote alongside two shirtless snaps on Monday, December 16, via Instagram. “You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain. I found out a year ago I was going to be in Marvel’s Eternals and decided I wanted to transform how I looked.”</p><p>Nanjiani credited his nutritionists and trainers for helping him prep for the role as Kingo in the new Marvel film Eternals.</p><p>“I would not have been able to do this if I didn’t have a full year with the best trainers and nutritionists paid for by the biggest studio in the world. I’m glad I look like this, but I also understand why I never did before,” he explained. “It would have been impossible without these resources and time. So big thanks to @grantrobertsfit who started working with me at the beginning of the year and made me understand true physical pain for months and months. Then, once we started shooting, a massive thanks to @davidhigginslondon and his team (@ellispartridge, @thebeardypt, @tomcheesemanfitness) for training me almost every day and making me strong, limber and injury free. I can almost touch my toes now. (And thank you for forcing me to do cheat meals David.) Matthews Street Catering for their delicious and healthy meals.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Kumail-Nanjiani-Debuts-Ripped-Body-Shirtless-Photos-01.jpg><p>The Silicon Valley actor concluded his post with a shoutout to his wife, <a href=#><strong>Emily V. Gordon</strong></a>.</p><p>“And finally, the biggest thanks goes to @emilyvgordon for putting up with me complaining and talking about only working out and dieting for the last year,” he gushed. “I promise I’ll be interesting again some day. #thirstyshirtless.”</p><p>Gordon, who married the actor in 2007, replied to his post in the comments section. “Worth it,” the Big Sick cowriter, 40, quipped.</p><p>The screenwriter wasn’t the only one who noticed.</p><p>“I think Emily is going to be ok.
