He is, for many, the best of all time.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But stand-up isn't exactly what made him the household name in comedy.</p><p>Chappelle's true launching pad to his now-stratospheric fame was his legendary skit&nbsp;show, Chappelle's Show, something he created with <a href=# rel=follow>Neal Brennan</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The Comedy Central show was a genre-defining one, the like&nbsp;of which has never been replicated.</p><p>At the heart of the show were its characters — outrageous, absurd, and most importantly, hilarious.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>And at the heart of many of those characters was Chappelle's brilliance, both in coming up with them and then bringing them to life. He portrayed around 25 characters during three seasons. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>While all of them deserve their feature pieces, there were some that truly left a mark on everyone.</p><p>Those are the unforgettable ones that people keep revisiting, the ones that have left a big&nbsp;imprint on pop culture.</p><h2>5. Lil Jon</h2><p>Chappelle brought the character of Lil Jon to life on February 25, 2004. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Chappelle's Show was his to bend and break as he wished, and it always had been a hip-hop-influenced program.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>So&nbsp;he put a bit of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">over-the-top spin</a> on Lil Jon, a character who already had a larger-than-life persona in reality. The first skit was named 'A Moment in the Life of Lil Jon.'</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Dave Chappelle portrays an exaggerated version of Lil Jon.</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">introduced the skit</a> on stage on the show, saying Lil Jon's music got him "so amped," but exaggerated the rapper's habit of saying "oh yeah" in his songs. And that was the entire premise of the sketch.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Chappelle portrayed Lil Jon dressed up in fake dreads, a cap and going through airport checking like any regular person. But, while communicating with the teller, the only words he uses are&nbsp;"YEAH!", "WHAT?" and "OKAY??"</p><p>He also calms down in-between his screaming, replying&nbsp;calmly in an accented voice.</p><p>But the loud single-word responses, which highlight the real Lil Jon's personality, are what makes the character funny and memorable.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">another skit</a>, Lil Jon is giving an interview, where again, his only responses are&nbsp;"YEAH!", "WHAT?", and "OKAY??" with a few sentences of calmness towards the end of the conversation. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-618 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>These were&nbsp;two of the many&nbsp;times Chappelle played Lil Jon, and the portrayal was so hilarious&nbsp;the skits turned into fond memories for comedy and hip-hop fans alike. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Even the show's producer loved it and tried copying Chappelle's version of Lil Jon.</p><h2>4. Prince</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Prince has long been one of Chappelle's Show fans' most-loved characters. And it's not just the fans who love the portrayal — Prince himself was a big fan.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The comedian's skit, 'Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood Stories — Prince,' first aired on February 18, 2004. And the story in the routine was based on a real event.&nbsp;</p><p>He wanted Prince to portray himself in the skit. But after the legendary singer refused, he decided to do it himself. And what a great job he did.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>In this one, Prince, Charlie Murphy, and his crew play a game of basketball.</p><p>Chappelle's Prince was dressed in a&nbsp;purple outfit with a blouse&nbsp;and wig; only he was much taller than the singer. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Donnell Rawlings, who portrayed the iconic Ashy Larry, another one of Chappelle's brilliant brainchildren, testified Prince was a huge fan of Chappelle's portrayal of him.</p><p>"He thought it was hilarious," Rawlings told <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Hollywood Reporter</a> in 2016. "And I think [Chappelle&nbsp;and Prince] really built a friendship after that sketch."</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Prince used Dave Chappelle's image, portraying him on 'Chappelle's Show,' as the cover for his 2013 single 'Breakfast Can Wait.'</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>Chappelle's Prince and the real person looked so similar&nbsp;that people mistook one for the other.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Prince even used an image of Chappelle dressed up as him as the cover for his 2013 single 'Breakfast Can Wait.'</p><h2>3. Clayton Bigsby</h2><p>Clayton Bigsby is as self-unaware a character as anyone can ever find on TV. Considered one of the best characters Chappelle has ever come up with, Bigsby is one hilarious fictional being.</p><p></p><p><strong>Dave Chappelle portrays Clayton Bigsby, a black, blind white supremacist.</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>He is a blind, black, white supremacist. But the thing he initially does not realize is that he is black because he's blind and nobody told him.</p><p>With a strong hatred for a race he does not realize he belongs to, he becomes the&nbsp;leading voice of the white supremacist movement in America.</p><p>He achieves&nbsp;this without a single public appearance. He never leaves&nbsp;his house without a white hood until his appearance on Frontline.</p><p>The public debut changes his life forever. He realizes he is African-American, at which point, he ends his 19-year marriage.</p><p>His reason? He did not want to be with a woman who dated outside her race;&nbsp;only he used more racist words to convey that.</p><p>The character's profoundly ironic existence and the generous use of the n-word made the skit more hilarious than any description could ever do justice.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p>And as the skit that started Chappelle's show, it set the bar really high for Chappelle.</p><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>2. Tyrone Biggums</h2><p>If Bigsby was the opening episode, Biggums was the second, and boy did Chappelle clear the high bar he set for himself.</p><p>Chappelle's crackhead <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">man-child character</a>, Tyrone Biggums, was a humorous take on addiction, coming&nbsp;at a time when the crack epidemic was still a big topic.</p><p>A homeless person, Biggums is a crack cocaine addict, quickly recognized by his white, blistered lips and constant scratching.</p><p>His other trademark character features are eating peanut butter and crack sandwiches and saying, "I smoke rocks!"</p><p>Many of his dialogues, such as "Y'all got anymore of..." and&nbsp;a particular line that shows his extreme willingness to perform oral sex on a man for the white powder&nbsp;have become a mainstay in the meme culture.</p><p></p><p><strong>Dave Chappelle portrays the always-itchy Tyrone Biggums.</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span><p>For Biggums, fear was never a factor when it came to getting some crack, as evident in his appearance on a spoof <a href=# rel=follow>Fear Factor</a> episode alongside <a href=# rel=follow>Joe Rogan</a>.</p><p>And neither was a lack of wide-enough passageways, as he once <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">flushed himself down</a> a toilet to escape rehabilitation.</p><p>With his recurring appearances within iconic sketches, Biggums became one of the most unforgettable characters Chappelle has ever written.</p><h2>1. Rick James</h2><p>If Biggums became&nbsp;legendary memes, Chappelle's Rick James became a phenomenon that transcended comedy itself.</p><p>Rick James isn't exactly a character but&nbsp;an exaggeration of Rick James, an American singer-songwriter's personality.</p><p>James, like Prince, appeared on 'Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood Stories,' for the first time on February 11, 2004.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span><p>Chappelle took James's character and elevated it to include exaggerated mannerisms and similar but REAL stories, narrated by <a href=# rel=follow>Eddie Murphy</a>'s brother Charlie Murphy.</p><p>Things like James slapping Murphy, referring to him as 'Darkness,' and the real James's&nbsp;interviews trying to justify his past behaviors all made Chappelle's portrayal amazing.</p><p>But the main thing people remember about James is his famous catchphrase — "I'm Rick James, [expletive]!"</p><p></p><p><strong>Dave Chappelle portrays an exaggerated version of Rick James.</strong> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>)</p><p>The line became so famous&nbsp;that it turned into something destructive.</p><p>There's one incident where, in 2005, a Mississippi city council candidate named Rick James, with no connection to James or Chappelle's portrayal of him, had a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">difficult time</a> trying to cope with the infamy of the dialogue.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_10"></span><p>His campaign slogan, "Vote Rick James," was often defamed by fans of the sketch, changing it to "Vote Rick James [expletive]!"</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">James's skit</a> was too big for its own good and became the ultimate reason Chappelle stopped doing the show.</p><p>While performing stand-up in 2004, the audience started chanting the dialogue, making Chappelle leave the stage mid-set.</p><p>Chappelle said he was getting frustrated with the success of the show and the impact it was having on his life.</p><p>So valuing his stand-up career more than the sketch show, he went on a hiatus in April 2005, ending once and for all&nbsp;what is probably the most brilliant sketch show to ever air on TV.</p><p>Nevertheless, for both good and bad reasons, James became Chappelle's most unforgettable portrayal, if not a character.</p><p>There are a few other brilliant characters, like Black Bush, Silky Johnson, and Leonard Washington, which did not make this&nbsp;list but still deserve honorable mentions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJyRq7Jur8eap6mdnKGybq%2FHmqmam6Sav7R6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
