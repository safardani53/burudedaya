The Hershey’s brand, which manufactures the beloved candy, announced on Monday, March 25, that not one, but two new versions of Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups are expected to debut nationwide in mid-April.</p><p>The candies, which were designed to give consumers “the chance to have more of what you love,” are Reese’s Chocolate Lovers and Reese’s Peanut Butter Lovers. As you may have guessed from their monikers, one confection places more of an emphasis on chocolate, while the other highlights peanut butter.</p><p>“For years, we’ve heard people debate their favorite part of a Reese’s Cup. Is it the chocolate or is it the peanut butter?” Natalie Perera, a Reese’s spokesperson, said in a statement shared with Us Weekly. “So, we decided to settle the score and make both sides happy by giving them what they want – Reese’s Chocolate Lovers and Reese’s Peanut Butter Lovers. As if we’d actually choose!”</p><p>Reese’s Chocolate Lovers, which are most similar to traditional Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, contain a higher proportion of milk chocolate that’s richer and darker than the standard sweet stuff. The treats also boast a thicker chocolate shell, making it the most chocolatey Reese’s cup to ever exist.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/New-Reese%E2%80%99s-Alert-See-Chocolate-Lovers%E2%80%99-Peanut-Butter-Lovers%E2%80%99-Candies-Chocolate-Lovers-Packaging.jpg><p>Reese’s Peanut Butter Lovers, on the other hand, feature a higher proportion of peanut butter and a visible peanut butter candy top shell. Both candies are only expected to be around for a limited time, and will be available in both regular and king size packages.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/New-Reese%E2%80%99s-Alert-See-Chocolate-Lovers%E2%80%99-Peanut-Butter-Lovers%E2%80%99-Candies-PB-Lovers-Packaging.jpg><p>Furthermore, to kick off the launch of the newest members of the Reese’s family, the candy brand is giving fans a first taste of the latest sweet treats via the Reese’s Swap Shop. At the establishment, consumers will have the opportunity to see if they prefer Reese’s Chocolate Lovers or Reese’s Peanut Butter Lovers candies. Then, they can swap something (anything) they love for an early taste of the new sweets before they’re officially released next month.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Reese’s Swap Shop will be open for two days only: Tuesday, March 26, from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m. ET and Wednesday, March 27, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET, at 321 Canal Street in New York City. Across the two days, the Reese’s team is expected to swap more than 10,000 new, limited-time-only Reese’s Lovers Cups, while supplies last.</p><p>This latest product comes about a month after the candy company released Reese’s Thins, which come in milk chocolate and dark chocolate varieties, and are 40 percent thinner than traditional Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqudlaiytHnDnpmurKNiu6bDjJyfqJufoa61sYylpq%2Bdoqh6sbHAp6ytZZKqwbWx0WajqK6Vp8Bur8Cnm6Kdo2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
