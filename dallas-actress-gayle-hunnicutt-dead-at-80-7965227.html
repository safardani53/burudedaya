Her ex-husband, journalist Simon Jenkins, confirmed her death to the outlet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hunnicutt is reportedly survived by her two sons Edward and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Band of Brothers </a>actor Nolan, as well as five grandchildren; Poppy, Theo, Oscar, Dash and Nia. The cause of her death has not yet been revealed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Along with starring opposite Larry Hagman for the final three seasons of Dallas, her other credits include The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, Fall of Eagles, The Golden Bowl and The Return of the Saint.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Famed as a beauty in her own right, Hunnicutt once said she'd most like to look like Audrey Hepburn, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Guardian</a>. She met her first husband David Hemmings at a party thrown by Rat Pack actor Peter Lawford. They married in 1968 and went on to welcome a son called Nolan.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Hunnicutt was famed for her beauty throughout her career.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Evening Standard/Hulton Archive/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The pair divorced in 1974 and in 1978, Hunnicutt married journalist and editor Sir Simon Jenkins with whom she had Edward. During her marriage to Jenkins, Hunnicutt became a firm fixture on the British social scene alongside her acting work. Jenkins and Hunnicutt lived in London’s Primrose Hill, before divorcing in 2000. Her sale of the house they had lived in for three decades became an episode of a 2012 reality show, Selling London.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hunnicutt grew up in Fort Worth, Texas, the only child of her father Sam, who served in the South Pacific during the Second World War, and her mother Virginia. Although she wanted to be an actress from the age of five, Gayle’s parents focussed on academic achievement and she won a scholarship to the University of California in Los Angeles to study English Literature and Theatre. It was while there that she was spotted by a Warner Brothers agent while taking part in a stage production. She made her debut on the television naval comedy Mister Roberts at the age of 23 in 1966.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Outside of film, Hunnicutt has a great stage presence, too.
