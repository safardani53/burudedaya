"The president's not in his early 90's yet."</p><p>Ken then gave the correct response: "What is 70."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2><strong>STAR TREBEK</strong></h2><p>In a <a href=#>Reddit</a> chat room, fans felt sympathy for the incorrect response.</p><p>"I think Ilena momentarily forgot the 'in 2012' part of the clue,<br>one person commented. "But Ken's snarky response made me chuckle."</p><p>Another defended: "Being in the top box, anyone's first response when they see 'age limit' + Biden will be 80. I had to rewind to see the writers had snuck that '2012' in there."</p><p>"I loved that. Felt very Trebekish, in a genuine way. Chiding contestants for making mistakes without being cruel is a tough balance to strike, and Ken's finding it," one said referring to late host <a href=#>Alex Trebek</a>.</p><p>In the end, it didn't matter, as Elliot entered Final Jeopardy! with an insurmountable lead of $27,200.</p><p>Second place Sarah Daily had $4,000 while champ Ilena was doomed with just $3,200.</p><p>No one had the correct answer for Final Jeopardy!, and Elliot ended up taking the crown with a total of $24,000.</p><h2><strong>WELCOME BACK</strong></h2><p>Meanwhile, fans were <a href=#>happy to find Ken back as host,</a> replacing Mayim for the end of the current season.</p><p>"Finally we can watch again!" one person remarked. " I know the host shouldn't matter so much, but Mayim really does make the show unwatchable."</p><p>Another added: "I don’t dislike Mayim, but I enjoy watching so much more with Ken hosting. He’s just objectively better at it in every aspect."</p><p>While a third bashed: "She is getting on my nerves more and more. She's probably talented for certain things, but definitely she is awful as host of Jeopardy with all her mimics, wiggles and bad timing.</p><p>"No improvement….she is a lost cause."</p><p><a href=#>The Writers Guild of America</a> (WGA) announced on May 1 that it was&nbsp;going on strike&nbsp;after weeks of talks with&nbsp;<a href=#>Netflix</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Amazon</a>,&nbsp;Sony (Jeopardy!'s parent company) and more - fell through.</p><p>Picket lines assembled the following day as writers protested over their contracts and pay.</p><p><a href=#>Mayim&nbsp;bowed out of hosting the last week</a> of Jeopardy!'s current season in a show of solidarity, which Jeopardy!'s decade-long writers thanked her for&nbsp;<a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on Twitter.</a></p><p>Writer Mark Gaberman wrote: ⁦⁦"Mayim,⁩ This means more to us than we could ever say. Thank you so much. #WGAstrong."</p><p>Longtime writers&nbsp;<a href=#>Billy Wisse and Michelle Loud</a>, striking as well, also recently told Variety: “Our words are on the screen every night.”</p><p>“There is no ‘Jeopardy’ without writers. Without us it’s just an empty blue screen.”</p><p>Jeopardy!&nbsp;features a small staff of WGA writers, and the clues were theoretically also written well in advance of the strike.</p><p>Ken was supposed to be off the board until the next season begins in September- and Ken has been criticized on social media for returning to the set as a result.</p><h2><strong>PICKING A SCAB</strong></h2><p>In May, just after the strike began, Ken sent out an ill-timed promotional tweet for a trivia book he wrote.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>game show millionaire</a>&nbsp;also shared the cover of his new trivia book under the tweet, while prompting his near-500,000 followers to buy it.</p><p>The tweet wasn't received well by many fans, who <a href=#>called Ken a scab</a> for stepping back in during the strike.</p><p>One person replied at the time: "You’re a writer? Interesting."</p><p>Another wrote: "Oh man. You should have waited until AFTER it came out to scab. Literally turned thousands of potential readers like me onto someone unable to support it."</p><p>More than a month later, Ken finally defended the&nbsp;<a href=#>controversial move</a>, insisting that the show's episodes were "already locked."</p><p>He tried to diffuse the bitterness, complementing the picketers to the Desert News: “You would not believe the work our amazing writers do, and they’re <a href=#>Emmy Award</a>-winning.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"We cannot wait for the strike to be resolved so we can get our writers back.</p><p>"We’re just hoping the writers get the fair deal they deserve [and] we can get back in time to the fall.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/fans-accuse-ken-jennings-snarky-829369945.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/fans-accuse-ken-jennings-snarky-829369944.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/07/quarterfinal-round-seven-celebrity-jeopardy-828294278.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwZWaDeH2UaKGep6CWv6XFjKScp2Wamruvtc2gqmaqlanCs7qMsKCnppWnerW7zaKeoaxdmrmttc6tq2ajmaJ8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
