The rapper took Julia on a dinner date to celeb hotspot Beauty & Essex in Hollywood on Saturday, Oct. 15. The night out will be the fourth time the pair enjoyed each other’s company in public after<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;taking in a movie, </a>visiting the Beverly Hills hotel, and grabbing dinner at Giorgio Baldi in Santa Monica, per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Kanye-West-Juliana-Nalu-backgrid-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>The dinner comes just hours before Kanye’s reaction to his ex <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kim Kardashian </strong></a>having&nbsp;sex with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Pete Davidson</strong></a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>front of a fireplace </a>was revealed. The “Gold Digger” rapper went on another<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;inflammatory tirade</a>&nbsp;when he stopped by the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Drink Champs</a> podcast, and during it, he brought up Kim’s episode of The Kardashians&nbsp;where she dished on intimate details about her&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>former romance</a> with the comedian. As fans know, Kanye’s rants can be unclear at times, but it appeared he was connecting the attention around the fireplace anecdote to “Jewish Zionists.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“I just want the family back together,” Kanye began. “Kim is a Christian. I just saw yesterday, it said, ‘Pete Davidson and Kim have sex by the fireplace to honor their grandmother.’ It’s Jewish Zionists who are about that life, that’s telling this Christian women that has four black children to put that out as a message to the media.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Kanye-West-Juliana-Nalu-backgrid-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Moments before the outburst on Kim and Pete, Kanye said, “First of all, we are Semite, we Jew, so I can’t be antisemite.” The references to both “Jewish Zionists” and “antisemite” come after the Grammy winner had his Instagram and Twitter accounts <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>suspended</a> last week after making <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>antisemitic posts.</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Kim, who shares <strong>North</strong>, 9, <strong>Saint</strong>, 6, <strong>Chicago</strong>, 4, and <strong>Psalm</strong>, 3, with Kanye, filed for divorce from him in February 2020 after six years of marriage. She dated the former Saturday Night Live funnyman from October 2021 through this past August.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Meanwhile, Kanye had quite a few other things to discuss during the podcast. He <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>claimed</a> his oldest daughter&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>North</strong></a>, 9, is missing how things used to be, as he said, “Nori just want the family back together.” He also suggested that he knows his sometimes-rival <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Drake</strong></a> had <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sex</a> with Kim’s mom <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a>. He also brought up his previous claim that he was kept from his daughter <strong>Chicago’s</strong> birthday party over the summer, saying “Kardashians kidnapped my daughter in public.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>In case you missed the episode of The Kardashians featuring Kim’s fireplace sex story, the makeup mogul was chilling with her grandmother, <strong>MJ Shannon</strong>, when she dished, “Pete and I were staying at the Beverly Hills Hotel last weekend and we were sitting in front of the fireplace just talking for hours. I was like, ‘My grandma told me that you really live life when you have sex in front of the fireplace.’ So we had sex in front of the fireplace in honor of you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5BvZqSZnq6ybsPErKtmnJGpsm65zp2cpWWaqrmqrc2aZKeZnKp6qbvLpbCwp5%2BZerG0zq2mrGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
