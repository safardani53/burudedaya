What happened to him?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter/@thekuhnerreport</a></figure><p>Although <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Kuhner</a> is a conservative radio host in one of the most liberal cities in the country, he has developed a loyal following during his time as the host of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Kuhner Report</a> in Boston. Jeff has been doing the show on WRKO for more than a decade. During that time, he has espoused a number of highly controversial views about politics and COVID-19.</p><p>Recently, though, some regular fans of Jeff's show have noticed that he has been absent. He has been replaced by a variety of fill-in hosts. Jeff's sudden absence has some people concerned, and others hoping that he'll return to the show soon. So, what happened to Jeff Kuhner? Here's what we know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Jeff Kuhner?</h2><p>Currently, it isn't totally clear what happened to Jeff. All we know for sure is that Jeff isn't in his normal slot in the mornings. In fact, one person on Twitter said that the fill-in host had been asked about Jeff. She said that couldn't speak to where he was or when he might be back.</p><p>The situation has some regular fans concerned that Jeff may have been fired from the station altogether.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter/@thekuhnerreport</a></figure><p>WRKO hasn't release any sort of official statement about Jeff, and his own social media handles have also been quiet during his absence. In this void and without any real information, all that fans can do is speculate about what happened to the radio host and hope that he'll return to his show as soon as possible to offer a more full-throated explanation.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Fans have expressed concern about Jeff's absence.</h2><p>In addition to one Facebook user who left the comment "BRING BACK JEFF ... NOW!!!" on multiple WRKO Facebook posts, many other Twitter users have also expressed concern about Jeff's absence.</p><p>"Jeff hope everything is alright with you," one person wrote in response to his most recent tweet.</p><p>"I love you, Jeff! Unfortunately, I don't listen to any fill-ins. Nothing against them. I want The Kuhner!!!! Going somewhere else for the morning," another person added.</p><p>One person also wrote in to apologize for a joke they had made, and to express sympathy for the reason that Jeff was out. This person seemed to suggest that they knew the reason he was absent, and also added that they didn't think it was something the general public needed to know. This makes it sound like some sort of personal matter, although the exact details are obviously still quite vague.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>What is killing our economy:</p>â€” Jeff Kuhner (@TheKuhnerReport) <a href=#>April 18, 2023</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jeff has been unexpectedly absent before.</h2><p>Perhaps Jeff's most notable recent absence came at the end of 2021, when he caught COVID-19 after railing against the virus on his radio show. Some online even speculated that Jeff was out again for the same reason, although that seemed to be more of a joke than anything else.</p><p>For now, Jeff's fans will just have to be patient and hope he returns soon. When Jeff does, he may provide an explanation as to why he was gone, or he may choose to simply move forward and ask for privacy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSjnZabeqzBx6ecqw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
