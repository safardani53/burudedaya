It's the stuff of panic attacks, but it's also the premise of FOX's new Wednesday night show, <a href=#>Almost Family.</a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The series centers on Julia, the daughter of this prize-winning pioneering fertility doctor, played by Brittany Snow, and in large part on the two new sisters she discovers she has: Roxy Doyle (Emily Osment) and Edie Palmer (Megalyn Echikunwoke).</p><p>Many fans of the latter 90210 star are wondering whether Megalyn Echikunwoke is married. <strong>Keep reading for what we know.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Megalyn Echikunwoke married?</h2><p>On&nbsp;<a href=#>Almost Family</a>, Megalyn plays Edie Palmer, Julia's former best friend. As the two of them, along with a third ex-athlete sister, Roxy, grow closer, "Julia&nbsp;must figure out what life is like without Leon [her dad] by her side," the show's synopsis reads.</p><p>We'll also watch Roxy leave behind her athletic career for a life outside the spotlight, and follow Edie as she comes to terms with "her burgeoning sexuality" as her marriage begins to falter.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Which leads us perfectly to the question of whether or not Megalyn Echikunwoke is married in real life.

It’s not a breakdown, but something in your life broke down,” Chris said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>And while this adorable couple has been going steady for three years now, even attending the recent Met Gala this past May, they have no intention of tying the knot.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Would I ever get married again? Not if it would cure AIDS," Chris joked in one of his stand-up specials. As for Megalyn, it doesn't seem she's too keen on marriage, either.</p><p>While Megalyn called her boyfriend a "very dreamy guy" in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, the star clarified she's "actually not a huge believer in marriage."&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>“If he made a really good case for it, I guess… I guess there’s this misconception about once you’re engaged how could you possibly want anything more than marriage and kids. It’s kind of like lock down a rich guy," she added.&nbsp;</p><p>Megalyn continued, "I’m here to say that there’s more to life than that, and this common lame notion that that’s all a girl could possibly want in life is completely bulls–t. So, I mean, I have a boyfriend who I love and that’s all I need."</p><p>The couple is absolutely adorable, that much is for sure. We can't wait to watch Megalyn and her hundreds of siblings when Almost Family airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. on FOX.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforKorcuypWadk522rMHNsKaknV2irrO%2ByJ6b</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
