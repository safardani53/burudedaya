And,&nbsp;of course, <a href=#>everything about the engagement</a>, from the ring, (which is a 20-carat pear-shaped diamond and set in a platinum split-shank halo band and is worth $2 million&nbsp;to the proposal was like a fairytale. Stylish sat down with Michael Greene the jeweler who created the ring with Hilton’s fiance, <a href=#>Chris Zylka</a> to get the scoop about how the ring was created, what inspired it&nbsp;and all of the traditions that Zylka follow leading up to the proposal. Oh, and the model may have made a smart investment with his choice as well — diamond expert&nbsp;Grant Mobley also recently told Us that<b>&nbsp;</b>natural diamonds (rather than laboratory-made sparklers) have a long history of increasing in value over time. Read on for all the details!</p><p><strong>Stylish:</strong> Tell Us, when did Chris come to you to start designing the ring?<br><strong>Greene:</strong> Five to six&nbsp;months ago, we started the process of finding the perfect pear-shaped diamond. On December&nbsp;20th I met with Chris at their N.Y.C.&nbsp;apartment&nbsp;while Paris was at the hospital with her sister&nbsp;Nikki waiting for her second baby to be born. Paris had no idea, Chris and I sketched out exactly how he wanted it … from there I took it back to my factory in L.A. to be built. Chris then came to my Beverly Hills showroom on December&nbsp;24th to pick up the finished ring and take it to show Paris’s father Rick and ask him for his approval.<br><strong>Stylish:</strong> How excited was he?<br><strong>Greene:</strong> Extremely. He said he finally had the confidence to ask her.</p><p><strong>Stylish:</strong> What was the inspiration behind the pear?<br><strong>Greene:</strong> Paris’s father gave her mother a pear-shaped stone —&nbsp;she loves the shape and elegant look. &nbsp;I think it’s about a bond with common style and memories.</p><p><strong>Stylish:</strong> How many rings did he look at before ultimately deciding?<br><strong>Greene:</strong> None. He knew exactly what he wanted.&nbsp;They have similar taste. He’s extremely attentive to her—when she makes little comments, he remembers them.</p><p><strong>Stylish:</strong> What goal did he have in mind when choosing the perfect ring for Paris?<br><strong>Greene:</strong> Chris wanted to give his princess her “dream ring.” &nbsp;He literally started shaking with excitement and was blown away with the ring. He said “This is it! So sick!”</p><p><strong>Stylish:</strong> You also mentioned that Chris went through all the traditional processes when proposing like asking her father for his permission to marry her.&nbsp;Was he nervous to ask Rick? Was he nervous to actually propose to Paris?<br><strong>Greene:</strong> Yes, he was nervous on both ends. When he picked up the ring from me, he was shaking, both with excitement and of course about going straight to see Rick.</p><p><strong>Stylish:</strong> You said that you and your team designed the ring in 2 days even though the process usually takes 3 weeks. How did you manage to pull that off?<br><strong>Greene:</strong> I have a full factory in LA which allows me full control of production. We had our guys work through the night.</p><p><strong>Stylish:</strong> Do you know why he proposed in Aspen?<br><strong>Greene:</strong> They both love the mountains and snow. He wanted to make the moment magical.</p><p><strong>Stylish:</strong> What was Paris’ reaction to the ring and proposal?<br><strong>Greene:</strong> She was stunned, super excited, and blown away by the ring. She called and said it couldn’t have been better. &nbsp;She got her “dream ring.” &nbsp;She was super happy he contacted me. &nbsp;She mentioned my name to him months ago, and he never showed any sign of interest, he played it off perfectly!</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Reporting by Carly Sloane.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6Wus7XSZp%2BipKSku7R5xKeemp%2BVorKvwIyroKefXZu%2FsLmMnJ%2BroaNix7q4yppknZ2jnrSvecOeq5qhnKh8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
