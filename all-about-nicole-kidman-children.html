She also has two daughters, Sunday Rose and Faith Margaret, with her longtime love <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Keith Urban</a>, to whom she's been married for nearly two decades.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kidman became a first-time mother in 1993, when she and her then-husband Cruise adopted their daughter Bella. A few years later, the pair welcomed son Connor into their family. Though Kidman and Cruise split in 2001, she told Elle in 2008 that the former couple's kids were raised "amidst a lot of love."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They are generous, kind and hardworking," Kidman later said of her two older children. "And these are <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>traits that I love to see in my children</a>."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After splitting from Cruise, the Being the Ricardos actress went on to marry Urban on June 25, 2006. Two years later, they welcomed their first daughter, Sunday Rose, in 2008, followed by her younger sister, Faith Margaret, in 2010.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kidman, who has been open about her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fertility struggles,</a> told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Marie Claire Australia</a> in 2021 that she always wanted a big family. "I would've loved 10 kids," she said. "I love mothering, I love kids: They're quirky, funny and unfiltered. And then you get to see them grow and send them on their way."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Matthew Simmons/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress further explained how she "prefer[s] children to adults" while speaking to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener">Glamour U.K.</a> in 2020. "It's just fun because I just find their perspective not so heavy," she said. "It puts you in a more childlike place where you go, 'I can move through this and it can be fleeting. It doesn't have to become a massive weight.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Kidman has mainly kept her kids out of the spotlight, she has shared a few anecdotes about her family life over the years. Her two younger daughters even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>made a rare appearance</a> — albeit virtually — alongside their mother at the 2021 <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Golden Globes</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From everything she's said about being a mother to her sweetest moments with her children, here's what to know about <a href=# data-inlink=true data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Nicole Kidman</a>'s four kids: Bella, Connor, Sunday and Faith.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bella-kidman-cruise-31></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Bella Kidman Cruise</strong>, 31</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>David M.

"And we lost a baby early on, so that was really very traumatic. And that's when we would adopt [our daughter] Bella."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though she grew up with her father in Beverly Hills, Isabella – who goes by the nickname Bella – has stayed mostly out of the spotlight. She graduated from West London's Delmar Academy of Make-up and Hair, before transitioning to a career in fashion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The burgeoning designer got her start working for Holmes and Yang, the fashion line of Cruise's ex-wife, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Katie Holmes</a>. She <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>started her own line</a>, BKC (a.k.a Bella Kidman Cruise), in 2018, selling t-shirts adorned with her own drawings.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Bella has been an artist her entire life.

In March 2023, she even <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>debuted a new hairstyle</a> on the app, showing off her newly dark brunette shag haircut and bangs.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-connor-cruise-28></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Connor Cruise</strong>, 28</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kelly Sullivan/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kidman and Cruise adopted their second child, son Connor, just after his birth in Florida on Jan. 17, 1995. Though her marriage to Cruise ended six years later, the actress has expressed her gratitude for the relationship, as it brought her her two older children.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I got married really fast and really young," Kidman said in 2012. "But I don't regret that because it got me Bella and Connor and I did have a fantastic marriage for a long period."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Connor grew up in Los Angeles, and got his first real taste of the spotlight in 2008, when he acted alongside <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Will Smith</a> in the drama Seven Pounds. Though he also had a role in the 2012 action film Red Dawn, he switched to music as a teen, releasing his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>debut single</a> in 2013 and landing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>DJ gigs</a> around the country.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Connor is also an avid deep-sea fisherman, a passion he attributes to his travels with his parents growing up. "We used to go fishing a lot when I was a little kid," he told PEOPLE in 2016. "I was blessed to travel the world as a young kid and now I'm traveling the world working."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The 28-year-old now resides in Florida and dedicates much of his time to fishing, as a source told PEOPLE in 2018. "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Connor has a pretty simple life in Clearwater</a>," the insider said. "He lives in his own home in a Scientology community. His life is deep-sea fishing.

According to PEOPLE, Kidman's father first suggested the name Sunday in honor of the Australian patron of the arts, Sunday Reed. The couple, who claim Sunday as their "favorite day," was clearly on board.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Sunday was young, the family relocated to Tennessee. In addition to picking up her parents' Australian lingo, Sunday adopted a bit of a Southern accent.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"My daughters are Nashvillians! They have a southern drawl," Kidman told PEOPLE in 2016. "They have some Aussie. They have an unusual mix. They're hybrids."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her Aussie accent isn't the only way she's following in her mom and dad's footsteps — Sunday has had a passion for music since she was a little girl. "She sings incessantly," Kidman said in 2010 of her then-2-year-old-daughter. "She has a repertoire of about 30 songs: 'The ABC Song,' 'Twinkle, Twinkle, Traffic Light,' 'So Long, Farewell.' "</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It seems like Sunday, now 14, wants to follow her mother into the filmmaking industry as well. In a 2018 interview for TIME 100, Kidman shared that Sunday was already thinking of pursuing a career in the entertainment industry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm raising a little girl that's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>showing an interest in directing right now,</a>" she said. "I want her to have a path for that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At the 2017 Palm Springs International Film Festival, Kidman told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>E!

Despite their fertility struggles, Kidman and Urban "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>never gave up faith</a> they'd have another child together," a friend of the couple told PEOPLE after her birth. As for her middle name, "Margaret" comes from Kidman's grandmother.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Juggling two young daughters with Kidman and Urban's busy careers isn't easy, though the actress told PEOPLE in 2019 that their family always comes first.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"At this stage in our lives, it's what works for the family and what works for our own joy," she said of avoiding jobs that mean too much time away from their daughters.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kidman and Urban have done their best to keep their daughters' lives private, though both Faith and Sunday have occasionally made public appearances over the years. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>They were extras</a> in their mom's HBO show Big Little Lies, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>voiced baby birds</a> in the film Angry Birds 2. The girls even became close with the children of Kidman's Big Little Lies costars, as she explained to PEOPLE.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-81 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They've grown up with those kids because I had them on-set around Monterey, and I'm like, 'Playdates, playdates!'

Speaking to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener">Glamour U.K.</a> in November 2020, she explained that Faith and Sunday were "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>working through the emotions</a>" of social distancing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"One of the hardest things is just watching them pine and yearn for their friends," she added.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Earlier that year, Kidman spoke to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener">Marie Claire Australia</a> about how her husband was outnumbered and had to retreat from the "female-heavy" house on occasion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-90 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>We're definitely female-heavy</a>!

" she joked, adding that her husband finds solace in one of his shared hobbies with Faith.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-92 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Oh, and he Googles cars — I'll know when he's stressed 'cause he's Googling cars," she said. "I couldn't care less what car I'm driving; you can pick me up in any old thing. But Keith and Faith love cars."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-94 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though Kidman rarely posts her children on social media, she did <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>share a sweet tribute</a> for Faith's 11th birthday in December 2021.
