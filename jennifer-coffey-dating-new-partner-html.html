However, her Instagram posts from January 2021&nbsp;to the present moment have brought much-needed "vitality" around her relationship rumors.</span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p><span>The first of such posts was brought up by the QVC host herself. On the post <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">uploaded</a>&nbsp;on January&nbsp;13,&nbsp;2021, Coffey could be seen&nbsp;taking a mirror selfie, while a mystery man stood beside her and planted a kiss on her cheek.</span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span>Some of her followers were quick to notice a ring on her finger, while others simply commented on the</span>&nbsp;host's relationship status.</p><p></p><p><strong>Fans show excitement and support in Jennifer Coffey's possible relationship </strong>(Source: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a>)<span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The jolly QVC personality shared <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">another</a>&nbsp;celebratory p<span>ost with the same gentlema</span>n<span>, just ten days later, on 23 January. The&nbsp;post featured&nbsp;a photo of Coffey and her man and a video of a waiter opening a large bottle of champagne. The caption of the post read, "Is it too late to post NYE pics?&nbsp;Also, swipe to see the champagne opening that summed up 2020"&nbsp;â€” this suggested&nbsp;</span>that&nbsp;she&nbsp;had celebrated the<span>&nbsp;</span>New Year's Eve of 2020 with him. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, the relationship between her and her speculated new partner&nbsp;hasn't&nbsp;been corroborated yet.

As per the Instagram&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">photo</a>&nbsp;the writer<span> </span>posted on December 23, 2019, she had to live with<span>&nbsp;</span><span>similar&nbsp;</span>devastating toxicity for quite some time. She was in a toxic relationship before she broke free of it in 2004.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><span>As made clear by the Instagram post, Coffey believed&nbsp;that everyone had&nbsp;certain hard experiences or trepidation that they had&nbsp;to endure. Some might have survived such throes, and some might still be struggling with it. But whatever the case may be,&nbsp;simple love, less judgment, and kind&nbsp;words could light the path for those struggling.</span></p><p>There is no shame in lack, no shame in struggle. Quite the opposite. Bless and praise every person on the journey. We are all in this together, even if it is acknowledged in silence.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlnmpq7r7XFnqlmm5%2Bbs6bFjJ2YraGenHqvsdZmp5qqpKOys3rHraSl</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
