"She was such a brave and special child. She showed me more strength and spirit than many adults I have met. I feel blessed that I was able to have her in my life, and know that through her example she has saved many lives. She was truly an angel on earth."</p><p>Jasmina first captured Rihanna's heart in 2008 after the R&B singer, 21, saw a video made by Jasmina's best friend and her mother in an effort to find the girl a bone-marrow donor. Rihanna — who made a special visit to NYC to see Jasmina last spring — followed up their video with her own video helping to find a donor.</p><p>On Monday, Jasmina, who received a bone-marrow transplant last year, was hospitalized after suffering fevers and shortness of breath. She was later diagnosed with pneumonia. By Wednesday, the girl's health had worsened. At 10:55 p.m. Wednesday, the girl passed away, her mother wrote on the <a href=#>Caring Bridge blog</a> she had set up to keep thousands of well-wishers up to date on the girl's condition.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Singer <strong>Kelly Rowland</strong> — who also grew close to Jasmina — tells <strong>UsMagazine.com</strong> exclusively that when she heard the news, "I was absolutely heartbroken.</p><p>"She was a brave and lovely little girl that captured my heart the moment I met her," she tells <strong>Us</strong>. "My heart goes out to her mother and best buddy, Isabelle and KMS- the organization that introduced me to her. Jasmina is with the angels now, may she rest in peace."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaroZiWu6%2BtjKGcmqqkl7%2Bwt8SnZJqepJq%2Fbq%2FHoqOdZaCWuW6%2F1JyarqWSqHq1u4ylnK6jlaK2onmRaWhpamhmfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
