You don’t get to see that too often on Jeopardy! LOL," wrote another.</p><p>"Does anyone know what he said? I kept rewinding but couldn’t catch it" asked a third.</p><p>"Something like 'can't get rid of me that easy'" wrote a fourth with a cry-laugh emoji.</p><p>One Twitter user wasn't loving it and wrote" "Pay attention to what Avi says to Jack after the first Daily Double when he gets the question right. It’s very faint but you can’t miss it. Very unsportsmanlike. Quite rude!"</p><h2>KEN TO SUB BACK IN SOON</h2><p>Over the summer and before Season 39,&nbsp;Ken and&nbsp;Mayim were announced as the permanent replacements for the&nbsp;<a href=#>late longtime host, Alex Trebek</a>&nbsp;who&nbsp;<a href=#>tragically passed away</a>&nbsp;from pancreatic cancer at age 80 in 2020, leaving huge shoes to fill.</p><p>It took two&nbsp;<a href=#>scandal-filled</a>&nbsp;years to fill them, and first Mayim was tapped and Ken soon after - but not before the show chose&nbsp;<a href=#>Mike Richards</a>, a former Executive Producer from the inside who had made&nbsp;<a href=#>sexist comments.</a></p><p><a href=#>Producers revealed today</a> that <a href=#>Ken Jennings</a>, 48, will be back after&nbsp;Mayim's&nbsp;three-week tournament.</p><p>"Reigning champ&nbsp;<a href=#>Stephen Webb</a>&nbsp;will return, along with&nbsp;Ken Jennings&nbsp;on March 10th in syndication," they said on the podcast Inside Jeopardy!.</p><p>"We're looking forward to seeing if Stephen's streak can continue!"</p><p>Ken's popularity as the show's host led to a Twitter account called @IsKenHosting which is tracking his onscreen whereabouts - and they claimed he'll be back for another month.</p><p>The aptly named Twitter account wrote: "Another reminder that Ken Jennings will *not* be hosting Jeopardy! starting next Monday, Feb. 20 through Thursday, Mar. 9 as the show airs its High School Reunion Tournament.</p><p>He'll return on Friday, Mar. 10 and that host stint is expected to last through at least April 14."</p><p>This is welcome news for Ken-leaning legions as many were fearing that after five enjoyable months he'd be off until next season, or September 2023.</p><p>Season 39 wraps up in July 2023, so both Ken and Mayim would have hosted for roughly five months each if Mayim hosts for the remainder of the season, which is why fans were reaching an inflection point.</p><p>The scheduling news also breaks the precedent the co-hosts need to evenly split hosting duties set last season, and could be an early indicator that Mayim will mostly stick to specials going forward.</p><p>After Mayim returned to&nbsp;Jeopardy!&nbsp;this week for the latest tournament, some of the show's spirited fans took to&nbsp;Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook to flat-out complain.</p><p>After Monday's debut, they&nbsp;<a href=#>criticized a contestant being awarded points</a>&nbsp;for a seemingly incorrect answer.</p><p>Under the category "National Anthems," the clue read: "Heard here is this British national anthem that has the same melody as 'My Country, 'Tis Of Thee.'"</p><p>College senior Audrey Sarin responded: "What is God Save the Queen," which Bialik accepted as the correct answer, leading to a debate online.</p><p>"Unless this was taped before the Queen passed the answer is God Save the King," one viewer tweeted, in reference to Britain's&nbsp;Queen Elizabeth II's death in September, with King Charles III becoming the monarch.</p><p>Elsewhere, others objected to the return of Mayim full-stop, with one viewer writing on Twitter: "Three weeks of Mayim Bialik on Jeopardy feels like I'm being punished for something. I probably deserve it but I'm still not happy about it."</p><p>The sitcom actress was originally going to switch in for winningest contestant Ken in December, but execs&nbsp;<a href=#>earlier revealed her schedule "evolved"</a>&nbsp;given her<a href=#>&nbsp;Call Me Kat</a>&nbsp;sitcom which has seemingly been her priority.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Last year,&nbsp;<a href=#>Amy Schneider</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Mattea Roach</a>&nbsp;said they prefer Ken, as did recent&nbsp;<a href=#>divisive three-day champ Jake Dearruda</a>&nbsp;slamming her as&nbsp;<a href=#>"inexperienced."</a></p><p>Even Mayim is aware of her mixed reception sharing on her own podcast recently: "Sometimes I get, 'We don't prefer you to Ken.'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/fans-shock-student-contestant-avi-797579343.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/fans-shock-student-contestant-avi-797579344.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/02/host-ken-jennings-shuts-contestants-793064202-4.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZGqFcX%2BUaKGep6CWv6XFjJqtomWXqr21rYyrnK6mmaS7bsDOrqmnmZ2au7V5yZqapGWTpLqusc2tZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
