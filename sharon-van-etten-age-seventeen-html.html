She has five studio albums to her credit, the most recent of which is&nbsp;'Remind Me Tomorrow (2019).'&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Early Life</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Van Etten was born on February 26, 1989 (age 40), in Belleville, New Jersey. The singer is&nbsp;the middle child of <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">five siblings</a>, including her. She grew up in Nutley, New Jersey, before moving to Clinton&nbsp;in the sixth grade.&nbsp;</p><p>The performer then went to North Hunterdon High School, where she was a member of the chorus and appeared in numerous musical productions. Van Etten learned the clarinet, violin, and piano as a child before switching to guitar. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>She started <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">writing</a>&nbsp;songs in high school and sang in the Madrigals, a choir group. Her choral encounters, she says, were crucial in teaching her how to note music and sing harmonies. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>In a 2019&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with Vera On Track, the musician revealed she got into music because of her mom. Even though the mother-daughter duo had a different taste in music, she was always encouraged to pursue music.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't like everything my mom likes, but she got me into musicals, and she took me to see Bruce Springsteen for the first time.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Van Etten moved to Murfreesboro, Tennessee, after graduation to attend Middle Tennessee State University in 1999, where she studied recording for a year before dropping out&nbsp;in 2000. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>During that period, the artist worked at Red Rose, a coffee shop, record store, and music venue in the city for over four years. Although she had written many songs throughout her&nbsp;time there, she never performed them.&nbsp;</p><p>She was a victim of an <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">abusive relationship</a> with a rock singer-musician whose jealousy distracted her from writing songs. One fine night, Van Etten left in the middle of the night with everything she could carry after five years.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>On Thanksgiving Day, she arrived at her parents, who hadn't spoken to her in a long time. Her mom answered the door as she carried the dishes she was about to place on the table, to find her "black-sheep middle child." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In another 2019&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interview</a> with Financial Times, the indie rock performer admitted that experiencing heartbreak added depth to get writing.</p><p>"But when you're happy and in love, there is still anxiety and fear about wanting to be with someone for the rest of your life and bringing life into this world. In that way, I still find the darkness in the light.", Van Etten added.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Later, she returned to New Jersey in 2004 and joined Raritan Valley Community College for a year. There, she worked at Perryville Wine and Spirits, before relocating to New York City in 2005.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>She also lived in Ditmas Park, a suburban <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">neighborhood</a>&nbsp;of Brooklyn, for several years where she played in small public events and recorded her songs on individual hand-painted CDs. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Van Etten lived in three boroughs and nine apartments for fifteen years before moving to Los Angeles in September 2019.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Van Etten kept performing, but she was still determined to learn more about the music industry. Fortunately, she secured an internship with Ba Da Bing Records, where she worked as a full-time publicist later.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The 'Seventeen' singer&nbsp;continued to release the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">handmade CDs</a>&nbsp;until her first debut album titled 'Because I was in Love,' on Language of Stone released in 2009. The album was manufactured and distributed by&nbsp;Chicago-based, Drag City.&nbsp;It received positive reviews.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>In 2010, she released her second album, 'Epic,' which was more band-oriented and received even more acclaim.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Jagjaguwar then signed the 40-year-old singer in late 2010. She then&nbsp;started her first National tour.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Van Etten's third studio album,&nbsp;'Tramp,' was released on Jagjaguwar in February 2012. Aaron Dessner of The National recorded and produced the album&nbsp;in his Brooklyn home studio. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The first single of the indie rock&nbsp;album to be released was 'Serpents.'</p><p>Doug Keith, Thomas Bartlett, Bryan Devendorf, Bryce Dessner, Matt Barrick, Rob Moose, Julianna Barwick, Peter Silberman, Logan Coale, Clarice Jensen, Ben Lanz, Zach Condon, and Jenn Wasner were among the musicians featured on the 2012 record.</p><p>Van Etten went back into the studio for her fourth album,&nbsp;co-produced with Stewart Lerman, 'Are We There,' with the help of her partner and manager, Zeke Hutchins.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>The album received some of the highest&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">critical acclaims</a>&nbsp;of any album to be released that year when it came out in May 2014.</p><p>In 2015, she released the five-track EP,&nbsp;'I Don't Want to Let You Down.'&nbsp;</p><p>Van Etten felt disconnected from her music and overwhelmed by the daily grind of professionally performing heartbreak. She took&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">a break</a>&nbsp;from music to finish her bachelor's degree in psychology at Brooklyn College. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>She had the hopes of becoming a licensed mental health professional.&nbsp;</p><p>During that time, she was noticed by a casting director and was called in for an audition for The OA. She was finalized for the role of Rachel, a fellow abductee along with Prairie in Dr. Percy's basement lab in the Netflix fantasy drama.</p><p>Van Etten <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">appeared</a> in ten episodes of the television series from 2016 to 2019. The actress also appeared on-screen as herself in the sixth episode of the 2017 series Twin Peaks. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After a break from her musical career, Van Etten released 'Remind Me Tomorrow' in January 2019, her fifth and the most <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">recent album</a>&nbsp;that found her venturing into new sonic territories.</p><p>However, her first track entitled 'Comeback Kid' from the album was launched in October 2018.</p><p>&nbsp;The performer took to her Twitter handle to make the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">announcement</a> of her new single,&nbsp;on October 2, 2018. She thanked her fans for the love and support for the past four years.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Dear fans,</p><p>Thank you so much for your support the past 4 years as I have gone back to school, had a child, and landed my first acting gig.
