The branding expert reportedly advises the world's top influencers, including Taylor Swift.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>You may have seen the name <a href=#>BJ Klock</a> floating around the internet over the last couple of weeks, and if you check out his Instagram, you’ll see that the 30-year-old is rich — like, stupid rich.</p><p>BJ is the CEO of Advisight, an invitation only market research center that helps the world’s top influencers grow their brands. The entrepreneur has even been credited with improving <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>’s social media presence. But who, exactly, are the company’s clients? Here’s what we were able to dig up.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did BJ Klock help Kim Kardashian become famous?</h2><p>Though the mother of four is rumored to be one of Advisight’s 2,734 members, the L.A.-based firm has a strict privacy policy, so her apparent connection to the business remains unproven. However, Kim’s enemy, <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>, appears in a picture on the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">company’s website</a>, indicating that she’s worked with BJ in the past.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Facebook</span></figure><p>The self-described "growth hacker" did hint on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his Instagram Stories</a> that he’s advised both Taylor and Kim, showing that his name is currently associated with the two women’s on Google Trends.&nbsp;</p><p>"Check this out and try it for yourself [to] see who is the most popular related inquiries to [Taylor Swift] & [Kim Kardashian] over the past week," BJ wrote. The Connecticut native also bragged about his name trending over Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg’s.</p><p>"I did all this without any investors, nothing, starting from legit scratch in the beginning," BJ stated. "I even had my car repossessed, lost my job, [kicked] out the crib I was living in. Crazy s--t happened lmao. The whole story will be told eventually, wait til [you] see the movie."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">BJ is also a musician who's recorded nearly a dozen songs.</h2><p>The "Time With Klock" host may be known for his business savvy, but he considers himself an artist, as well. "I love music. It’s always been a passion of mine and when I make music I truly feel relaxed and at peace," BJ told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jimmy Star’s World</a> in an interview last month.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"Music really gives me peace of mind. I use music as a tool to bring people joy, inspiration, and positive vibrations," he continued. "I’ve come to realize music is the best marketing piece on planet earth… I love what music does for the world when it is used properly."</p><p>BJ explained that he started doing music before marketing, but quickly realized that he needed to make money another way in order to pursue his dream of becoming a successful recording artist. "[Building brands] led me to creating a media empire which has led me right back to music, my original passion and love," he shared.</p><p>"I make music and my show for fun and to help inspire and guide people," the investor added. "I realized life isn’t about accumulating things and money, it’s about providing a valuable service and serving people. I really get most the joy out of helping amazing people see their dream come to fruition."</p><p>Still, having an estimated net worth of just under $100 million isn’t a bad way to go through life.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbalecGjZKSkn5i4brTEpadmo5mieqyt0Z2YrKCZlrtursScpqadXZuurrvUrA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
