So be it,” the marketing manager, 27, exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>ahead of the season 4 premiere earlier this month. “<a href=#>What she did for me was make me laugh and reminded me who I am</a> [and] that I like to laugh. I like to joke, like, this is a really serious situation, but I don’t have to be miserable. Like, I can enjoy myself a little bit and she gave me that, and for that, I don’t regret it.”</p><p class=p1>Micah continued: “I think there’s gonna be a lot that you don’t see on the show of <a href=#>amazing connections that I had with other girls</a> and stuff, but you know what? [Irina] was what I needed at the time, and I think she’s a great person. I really do.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Love-Is-Blinds-Micah-Lussier-Defends-Irina-Solomonova-After-Mean-Girl-Criticism-Feature.jpg><p class=p1>Both Micah and Irina, 26, were <a href=#>cast as participants on the Netflix reality series</a>, which premiered its fourth season on Friday, March 24. Within the first few episodes, they each <a href=#>found themselves in the center of a love triangle</a>. Micah, for her part, was torn between <a href=#><strong>Kwame Appiah</strong></a> and<strong> Paul Peden</strong> — who each struggled to pick between her and either <strong>Chelsea Griffin</strong> or Amber Wilder, respectively. Irina, meanwhile, quickly hit it off with criminal defense attorney <a href=#><strong>Zack Goytowski&nbsp;</strong></a>despite his own challenges to choose between the Solo founder and fellow contestant <strong>Bliss Poureetezadi</strong>.</p><p class=p1>A rivalry between Irina and Bliss, 33, intensified as their respective feelings for Zack, 32, continued to grow in the pods. Things reached a boiling point when Irina seemed jealous that the senior program manager was <a href=#>baking cupcakes for Zack’s birthday</a> — while she forgot what day it was. Both women even complained about one another to the Seattle resident, leaving him feeling torn about his final decision.</p><p class=p1>After going back and forth, the fitness enthusiast<a href=#> ultimately ended his romance with Bliss i</a>n favor of Irina, who <a href=#>he proposed to sight unseen</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Love-Is-Blinds-Micah-Lussier-Defends-Irina-Solomonova-After-Mean-Girl-Criticism-Inline.jpg><p class=p1>“I think that no matter what choice I made, <a href=#>my heart was going to break</a>, and it doesn’t mean that I’m not in love with Irina, it just means that I’m hurting from what I had to tell Bliss that I’d made up my mind,” Zack said during a confessional interview. “I chose Irina because she’s the one I trust the most.”</p><p class=p1>While the lawyer was overjoyed to eventually walk down the aisle with Irina, their post-pod connection hit a snag after his fiancée admittedly <a href=#>didn’t feel an in-person spark</a>. The Russia native, however, did feel “so inspired” by her brief conversation with Paul, 29, who got engaged to Micah on the show. In a teaser for the upcoming episodes, Irina is seen confessing her feelings to her&nbsp;<i>Love Is Blind&nbsp;</i>pal, who did not have a chance to respond before the screen cut to black.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><i>The first five episodes of Love Is Blind are currently streaming on Netflix.
