The singer was wearing a blue, white, black and orange tight dress when she showed up to the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup 2020 event at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the impressive fashion choice helped her to put her adorable bump on full display. She also showed off a short blonde bob as she walked around and sometimes posed for pics during the outing.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Katy’s latest appearance as a mom-to-be is part of just one of many events she’s planning on attending in Australia over the next few days, including a benefit concert to raise money for the tragic bushfires that have devastated the country. She’ll have many opportunities to keep showing off that growing bump and from the smile on her face at the World Cup, it seems she’s ready for it.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Katy’s outings in Australia come just two days after she announced her pregnancy to the world in the music video for her new song “Never Worn White” on Mar. 4.
