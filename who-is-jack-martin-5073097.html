The Riverdale actress was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photographed kissing</a> <strong>Jack Martin </strong>outside of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) on Apr. 10. She wrapped her arms around Jack’s shoulders during the kiss while the 24-year-old actor pulled Lili in close. With Cole moving on to date model <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ari Fournier</a></strong>, it’s safe to say that “Bunhead” – at least, the real-life pairing of Cole and Lili – is over.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jack-martin-5-things-to-know-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>In March, Cole <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dished on the Call Her Daddy podcast</a> about how difficult it was to work alongside Lili on Riverdale following their split. “I think the work thing got difficult because it was hard to suspend the way we felt about each other,” he said. ” It didn’t afford us the luxury of distance to really overcome that. I think we both did quite a bit of damage to each other.” Cole — who also <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>revealed that his new relationship</a> has helped him become sober and get his head right — said that he and Lili are “good friends now.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>With that said, let’s get to know a little bit about Jack.</p><a title=@jackmartin href=# rel=nofollow>@jackmartin</a><p id=content-paragraph-5>Getting your friends to pay you back</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><a title="♬ Hand Covers Bruise - Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross" href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>♬ Hand Covers Bruise – Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross</a></p><h2>Jack Martin Is An Actor.</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Jack’s first listed role was in an episode of the television series, All Rise in 2020. However, his breakout came a year later when he appeared as Josh Harris in the NBC sci-fi drama&nbsp;La Brea.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“I feel like I’ve aged about 30 years in the past,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>A Book Of</a>. “It’s just a really, really crazy ride for me. This has all happened so fast. Literally, my entire acting career and anything connected to it happened during COVID. I graduated college [in] December 2019, I was class 2020. I graduated early. And then all of a sudden, my TikTok account blew up, and then I moved to LA, and then I got signed by an agent. I booked La Brea in February of this year, and six months later, all of a sudden, now it’s the number one new show on TV.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“I mean, it’s just like, I can’t believe things can happen this fast, you know? Yes, it’s really just insane. It was so many things at once for me because obviously, it was my first big acting role but also it was a confirmation that I’m actually going to be able to do this for a living,” he added. “It was also my first real job. I mean, I’ve had internships and I had jobs at coffee shops and stuff like that. But, like living on my own and going to new country, it was just like a million different things for me at once.”</p><h2><strong>He Is A TikTok Star.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>As of April 2023, Jack has over 830k followers on TikTok. “I was already trying to do [acting] before TikTok, and I was sort of an elitist about it,” he told A Book Of. “I was like, ‘I’m never downloading TikTok. That’s for kids to do shirtless dances, I’m never getting that app.’ And I just kind of reached the point where I was like all right, whatever, I’ll get it. And I had this moment that I remember so well, where I suddenly realized I was like, oh my God, this is just a platform where I can make anything. I don’t have to be dancing in slow motion, I can do anything I want.”</p><a title=@jackmartin href=# rel=nofollow>@jackmartin</a><p id=content-paragraph-12><a title=stitch href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#stitch</a> with @_whittington</p><p id=content-paragraph-13><a title="♬ original sound - Jack Martin" href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>♬ original sound – Jack Martin</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-15>“What I love about TikTok is it’s really just about the quality of the content. I mean, you can have a million followers, and a video can do really poorly, you can have zero followers, and the video can go viral if it’s really good. It’s actually about making stuff that you believe in, stuff that you care about, that people want to see,” he adds.</p><h2><strong>Where Was Jack Martin Born?</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>Lili calls Cleveland home (though she’s been living in LA since she was 18.) According to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his IMDB bio</a>, Jack was born <strong>John Martin </strong>on Aug. 3, 1998, in Columbia, Maryland. ” Growing up in McLean, Virginia, Jack’s first connection to acting came from a wild experience in fifth grade, when he fell just short of a big part in a major feature film and realized how much he loved acting.”</p><a title=@jackmartin href=# rel=nofollow>@jackmartin</a><p id=content-paragraph-17>STOP listening to beta haters and drinking water! <a title=alpha href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>#alpha</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-18><a title="♬ Sigma (Drive Forever Freestyle) - Leoill" href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>♬ Sigma (Drive Forever Freestyle) – Leoill</a></p><h2><strong>Where Did Jack Martin Graduate College?</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-20>Jack’s IMDB bio states that he graduated from Georgetown University in December 2019. He also spent some time in the Big Apple, taking summer courses at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts (as well as studying at the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>“I went to college to study political science with the hopes I’d go into a career in politics and changed my mind after the first semester,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Bello magazine</a>. “This is obviously a big shift from that, but I have no regrets.”</p><h2><strong>He’s Inspired By Leo.</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-22>“I’ve always been big on <strong>Leo DiCaprio</strong>, especially in his younger days – his performance in Titanic is so legendary it’s the only movie I have downloaded on my phone,” he told Bello. “There’s something inspiring to me about actors who can both deliver a quality, nuanced character performance that is also relatable enough that everyone can see and connect to it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K3oq%2FKZqSaqqSeu26Bj3BqaXFnZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
