And then some.</p><p>“I, at one point, during my rock bottom and spiral, was getting blackmailed.

I’m gay."</p><p>"I came to terms with that earlier this year, and the next step in all of this was sort of letting people know.”</p><p>Underwood deserves nothing but praise for taking this step. It was brave of him to do so.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>But Colton was also accused last year of stalking Randolph after their split.</p><p>She told the authorities he even <a href=#>placed a tracking device on her car</a> and ended up getting a restraining order against her ex.</p><p>In November, the pair settled their differences and signed an agreement, which means Underwood can’t speak in great detail about what happened.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>However, he acknowledges having acted in an inappropriate manner and spoke to Variety about a petition on Change.org.</p><p>It has been signed by 35,000 people to date and its aim is to pressure Netflix to cancel an upcoming Underwood series due to these allegations.</p><p>"I did not physically touch or physically abuse Cassie in any way, shape or form,” Colton says now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>He added:</p><p>“I never want people to think that I’m coming out to change the narrative, or to brush over and not take responsibility for my actions, and now that I have this gay life that I don’t have to address my past as a straight man."</p><p>"Controlling situations to try to grasp at any part of the straight fantasy that I was trying to live out was so wrong.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Cassie has said very little about Underwood’s sexual orientation reveal, and even less about what transpired between them last summer.</p><p>“It’s not who I am as a human being, and it’s not how I carry myself,” Underwood continued to Variety.</p><p>“If there was anything I could do to take more ownership, I would."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"But also," he says of his ex, "out of respect to her, I don’t want to get into the details."</p><p>"I want this interview to be the last time I address her, because it’s not fair for her to have her name in articles every time I talk."</p><p>"I’m sorry, and I want her to know that I hope she has the best, most beautiful life.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Elsewhere, as previously reported, <a href=#>Underwood attempted suicide</a> last year.</p><p>He admits to Variety that&nbsp;he took an excessive amount of pills in the summer, recalling:</p><p>"I tried to end my life, and it didn’t work."</p><p>"That was the saddest and most confused and most hurt [feeling]."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Colton – who has previously said that he questioned his sexuality way back in high school – also confesses here for the first time that he did fool around with men prior to striking it big on reality TV.</p><p>"I’ll say this. I was ‘the Virgin Bachelor,’ but I did experiment with men prior to being on The Bachelorette."</p><p>"When I say ‘hookups,’ not sex."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"I want to make that very clear that I did not have sex with a man, prior to that," he adds.</p><p>Semantics aside, Underwood said he felt "so guilty" during his relations with men.</p><p>Nevertheless, he joined Grindr under an alias in 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>He explains thusly:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"It was my first time letting myself even go there," he said of trying out the dating app.</p><p>"So much so that I was like, ‘I need The Bachelorette in my life, so I could be straight.’"</p><p>Pretty incredible admissions all around – whatever you think of some of his decisions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>How is he feeling and doing these days?</p><p>After coming clean in so many ways, like never before?</p><p>“I’m the happiest and healthiest I’ve ever been in my life," he tells Variety.</p><p>"That means the world to me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Wow, huh?</p><p>There’s a lot to unpack here.</p><p>Where do YOU stand on Colton’s story?
