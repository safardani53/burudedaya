Nicola opted for a sheer blouse, which she paired with loose-fitting jeans and cream-colored platform heels. Brooklyn, for his part, looked timeless in a checkered blazer atop a white T-shirt and light-wash jeans. On his feet, he sported black lace-up boots.</p><p>The couple harmonized their style again for the Givenchy spring/summer 2023 presentation, wearing tailored black suits that still managed to reflect their own personal aesthetics. Nicola’s two-piece was cinched at the waist — thanks to a metallic clip — while Brooklyn’s featured a more relaxed fit. The <a href=#>Transformers star</a> accessorized with a fuzzy black bag as the son of <a href=#><strong>Victoria</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>David Beckham</strong></a> rocked black sunglasses.</p><p>Their most standout fashion moment, however, came on their wedding day. Brooklyn looked dapper in Dior as Nicola walked down the aisle in a Valentino Haute Couture gown, which featured a cascading train. She complemented the dress with lace gloves and a long veil. The bride opted not to wear a dress by Brooklyn’s mom, who is a fashion designer, and it was quickly assumed that the women were feuding.</p><p>As rumors swirled, the <a href=#>Holidate</a> star later <a href=#>cleared the air</a> about her dress of choice in an August 2022 interview with <a href=#>Variety</a>. “I was going to and I really wanted to, and then a few months down the line, [Victoria] realized that her atelier couldn’t do it, so then I had to pick another dress,” Nicola confessed to the publication. “She didn’t say you can’t wear it; I didn’t say I didn’t want to wear it. That’s where it started, and then [people] ran with that.”</p><p>Brooklyn, for his part, brushed off the alleged drama. “I’ve learned [social media users are] always going to try to write stuff like that,” he told the outlet. “They’re always going to try and put people down. But everyone gets along, which is good.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>On their <a href=#>six-month anniversary</a> in October 2022, Nicola gushed over her husband via Instagram, writing, “6 months as your wife and forever to go. I love you so much baby.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Brooklyn and Nicola’s best couple style moments:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvBq6aoo5yuu26uxJyioZmdYruqr86lmGaolaHBu7%2BMm5ysrF2YvLa8y55krKypobJuuc6mnKeso2K9qq%2FSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
