Nearly one year later, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a> reported that the outlet had obtained a copy of the birth certificate, which reportedly stated that the baby is named RZA Athelston Mayers.</p><p>RZA is almost certainly a tribute to <a href=#>Wu-Tang frontman RZA</a> (whose real name is Robert Fitzgerald Diggs), and Athelston is A$AP's middle name (his full given name is Rakim Athelston Mayers).</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Rihanna's baby's astrological sign?</h2><p>Now that we know the little guy's name, we can add that to what we know about what his astrological chart looks like, thanks to astrologer Lisa Stardust, author of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Saturn Return Survival Guide</a> and creator of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Astrology Deck</a>.</p><p>“The baby was born with a Taurus sun and the Libra moon," she says. "The sun is on the north node, so he's probably going to be famous too. I think he’ll be creative and artistic. I don't really get music vibes just because the moon is in Libra ... He could be a fashion designer.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>It's possible little RZA will give Fenty a run for its money in the future, if his astrological chart has anything to do with it.</p><p>With his Taurus and Libra placements being ruled by Venus (in Aries, no less), he's going to be "a real go-getter."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"Mercury is retrograde in Gemini in the chart, so he is going to be someone who does things a little bit backwards, and takes some time to kind of find his groove," Lisa says. "He’s going to be really successful, but the only caveat is that he might be a little bit insecure … He's just going to seek more attention from his dad."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Rihanna's due date for baby No. 2?</h2><p>Now that we know the name of Rihanna's first kid, it's time to start speculating about baby No. 2!
