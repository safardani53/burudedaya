Janney spilled what happened behind-the-scenes during The Tonight Show With <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong></a> on Wednesday, April 14.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“The producers see me like this and they’re like, ‘What have you done?! How are we gonna do …? You should have asked us before you did this to your hair,’” she exclaims to Fallon.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Allison-Janney-Says-Mom-Producers-Freaked-Out-When-She-Showed-Up-On-Set-With-Gray-Hair-Inline.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>While the sheer shock of Janney’s shorter silver style sent producers into a tizzy, there really was no need to get all up in arms.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I’m like, ‘Guys, I’ve been wearing a wig since season 1, but nobody knew it.’ So, everybody in the world knows about it now,” she adds.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>It’s safe to say that Janney’s new ‘do didn’t cause any difficulties during the final season of the show. And while she’s embracing a wig-less life now, she still wanted to take her loyal wig (and some loungewear!) home from set as a souvenir.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“That wig is coming with me, and a few pairs of <a href=# data-link=1>sweatpants</a> because my character Bonnie loved to be comfortable, as does Allison Janney. So I took a lot of sweatpants,” she told Fallon.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Earlier this month, the starlet shared just <a href=#>how much she loves her low-maintenance hairstyle</a>. “I cannot tell you how amazing it is to feel free. Free from hair color and hair extensions and hair tapes and blah blah blah,” the I, Tonya star said during an interview on The Drew Barrymore Show.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>An added perk? She has smooth, silky strands that can be stroked sans the fear of an extension falling out on the street. Because yes, that happened.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“To be able to run my hands through my hair — and hopefully sometime a man will be able to run his hands through my hair — and appreciate it is just, it’s heaven,” she said.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Janney continues: “One time I was flirting with this guy. I was walking down the street in New York, just putting my hands in my hair, and two extensions came out and I just was dropping them on the ground.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5a5rbXSqKVmopGju6bFjKyYsqtdoryuec%2Brpp2tk5q%2FtHnPmqWim5uasW671Z6pZqCVp3qovsCyZKGZmad8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
