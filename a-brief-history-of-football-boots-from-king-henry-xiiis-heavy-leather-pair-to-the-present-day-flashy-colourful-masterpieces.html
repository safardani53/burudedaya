Or even the 19th century? How about the 16th century?</p><p>That's right, there's even records of the leather footwear circulating during the 1500s...</p><p>With that in mind, <a href=#>SunSport</a> runs through the history of football boots - from the very start, to the present day.</p><h2>1526: A royal pair</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000229239949.jpg><p><strong>BELIEVE it or not, the earliest record of football boots dates all the way back to 1526.</strong></p><p>King Henry VIII was on the throne at the time - and on his list within the so-called 'Great Wardrobe' was a pair of boots.</p><p>They were designed and put together by royal shoemaker Cornelius Johnson for the sum of four shillings - around Â£100 in today's money.</p><p>Unfortunately there is no example left in the world - however they were described as being ankle high, made of thick leather and extremely heavy.</p><p>I wonder how <a href=#>Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, <a href=#>Lionel Messi</a> and Co would cope in them...</p><h2>1800s: A steely show</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000001040961.jpg><p><strong>DURING the 19th century, football was still predominately an amateur sport, a hobby and little more - at least, until the very end of the 1800s.</strong></p><p>To begin with, would-be heroes would wear their work boots, often with tacks hammered into the soles as makeshift studs, and a steel toe cap.</p><p>Imagine getting a whack in the leg with one of those...</p><p>As the sport became more mainstream and ultimately professional, a 'slipper' style was introduced to replace the standard high-cut boot - with new rules stating all studs must be rounded leather.</p><p>As the years went on, the ankle high style remained to increase protection, while the leather - when wet - would double in weight.</p><p>Imagine playing Stoke on a cold Wednesday night in those.</p><h2>1900 - 1940: Studs-up</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000000989204.jpg><p><strong>WITH football stars suddenly earning a wage and the popularity blossoming, boots were becoming more and more fashionable.</strong></p><p>In fact, companies were springing up specifically creating the footwear - complete with replaceable studs for the various weather conditions.</p><p>Hugely innovative for its day - but after all, the unpredictability of the British weather almost insisted on it...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000261707723.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">RELATED STORIES</h2></p><h2>1940 -

created by the fleet-of-foot South Americans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000261707764.jpg><p>And in 1948, German shoemaker Adolf Dassler fell out with his business partner - and brother - Rudolph and formed his own company, which he named adidas.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rudolph went on to found Puma in the same year - and two major boot brands were suddenly competing for custom, only furthering the advancements of the footwear.<br></p><h2>1960 -

with the game increasingly more popular, especially in England following their 1966 World Cup heroics.</strong></p><p>Suddenly brands became fashionable, as well as simply useful, as <a href=#>Pele </a>donned Puma boots in the 1962 World Cup.</p><p>Four years later and 75 per cent of players were wearing adidas.</p><p>With popularity booming, Mitre, Joma and Asics all kicked-off their manufacturing of the footwear.</p><p>The birth of the iconic Puma King series with Pele once again at the head of it all.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000261707781.jpg><p>This all happened during the era of player sponsorship - with certain boot companies jumping on the bandwagon, signing up the biggest name in the sport.</p><p>With the advances in boots, suddenly lighter boots were a hit - and white was the black as companies realised, the dark colour wasn't the only option.</p><p>Adidas also launched their Copa Mundial and Predator ranges in this era, while Diadora, Umbro and Lotto also came into fruition.</p><p>Certainly more than just a piece of leather now, with the world and his wife looking for a slice of the action...<br></p><h2>1990s: The Predator</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000001112378-e1472049733891.jpg><p><strong>NOW, the adidas Predator boots already existed at this stage, but the 90s was where it really came into its own.</strong></p><p>The revolutionary design, style, colour and technology was an instant hit with professionals and Sunday League heroes alike.</p><p>The more flexible boot also saw the introduction of a blade option - replacing the century-old stud.</p><p>From there, adidas battled with Mizuno, Reebok and Uhlsport for the ultimate boot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000261708939.jpg><p>But joining the party as late as the 1990s? Sporting giant Nike...</p><p>Nike introduced its iconic Mercurial range, weighing a tiny 200g - compared to its rivals who were still languishing around the 500g mark.<br></p><h2>2000 - Present: More than&nbsp;just a boot</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000260061836.jpg><p><strong>THESE days it's clear: Football boots are more than just a simple piece of footwear.</strong></p><p>They're stylish, colourful, safe, yet still built for purpose.</p><p>The improvement has been mind-boggling - with boots getting lighter still, more like a second-skin these days, safer around the ankle and fine-tuned in every way possible.</p><p>And to think, it all started with King Henry VIII...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/facebook-promo-football2.png><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLOwu9ObmKWkX2aDd4KTbGxomV2Xv6qxxWafoqukpL%2B6ec6fZJ%2Bnn6mvorjLZpmop6Soeqe%2BzqZkpKGenHqpsc2rsGawmZ62tHnHnpivsV2hsqLAx56pZqiRnr9uwM5mq6GdXaW%2Fpr%2FEp6tmnJGueqe4wKyfsmWTpLmwwdGfrKVlnZbAtbHRqaCem5WofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
