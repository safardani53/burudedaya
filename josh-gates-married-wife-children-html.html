However, Josh Gates and his wife Hallie Gnatovich are among the few couples who met as coworkers and carried on their chemistry to create a beautiful fairytale life for themselves.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>They met on the production set of Destination Truth and have been married for more than six years now. Together, they have two beautiful children: Owen and Isla. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>From Working Together to Being Married</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The adventurous duo&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">met </a>on the production sets of Destination Truth, where&nbsp;Gnatovich worked as a researcher. They acquainted with each other while filming the five season-long series from years 2007 to 2012.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After establishing a professional relationship, the duo started dating, and two years after the end of the show, the couple finally tied the knot on September 13, 2014.</p><p>Maintaining privacy, the duo married in secret at the Hidden Pond Luxury Resort in Maine with the company of their family, friends, and co-workers.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>In the completion of the first year of marriage, Gates posted an adorable <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">picture</a> of the two. In the caption, he mentioned how the decision to marry Gnatovich was one of the easiest and the best decision he had made in his life. He also wished his other half a happy anniversary and tagged her in the post. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>After almost a year and a half of their marriage, the couple gave birth to their first child, Owen Gates. As opposed to the couple's secretive personality, the news of Gnatovich's pregnancy was public;&nbsp;the excitement of being parents probably got the better of them.</p><p>The celebrity wife posted about her pregnancy on her social media handle. As for the television presenter fans, they got to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">see</a> a rare glimpse of the&nbsp;star's genuine emotions on the screen. This was&nbsp;when the Expedition Unknown crew filmed the moment when he first received the news of his wife’s pregnancy.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>However, the couple successfully kept the pregnancy deets about their second child away from the media's prying eyes. In fact, the news was only revealed to the public after the baby was born. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Grateful for the opportunity to be traveling by charter today.

She had also landed a minor role in a short film and worked&nbsp;behind the scenes in various productions.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>However, the aspiring actor had been rethinking her career path when she met her soulmate on the sets of Destination truth.&nbsp;She then set her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">sights</a>&nbsp;on a career relating to therapy. She completed her master’s in Marriage and Family Counseling in 2009, and after a period of training and certification, she opened up her own practice with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hallie G.
