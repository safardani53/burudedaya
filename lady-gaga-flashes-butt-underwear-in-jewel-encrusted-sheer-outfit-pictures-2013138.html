The button-pushing pop star, who has been sharing photos of herself dressed down and makeup free in recent weeks, stepped back into a pair of her trademark black lace-up, high-heeled booties for an outing in West Hollywood on Sunday, Aug. 11 — two weeks before she’s set to return to the stage at the MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday, Aug. 25. (The pop star’s new single, “Applause,” was released one week early, on Monday, Aug. 12, after hackers reportedly leaked the track online.)</p><p>The singer wore an eye-popping jewel-encrusted, sheer bodysuit that revealed a black bra and thong underneath for her date night with boyfriend <strong>Taylor Kinney</strong>. She topped off her look with a pair of black sunglasses and an oversized black-and-gold spiked <a href=# data-link=1>purse</a>.</p><p>Kinney, meanwhile, kept things casual with a black hood, jeans, and converse <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a>. The Chicago Fire actor let his girlfriend of nearly two years have the spotlight as he kept just two paces ahead of her on their way out of the Chateau Marmont.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lady-gaga-taylor-kinney-inline.jpg><p>Earlier in the day, Gaga strode down the streets of West Hollywood in a slightly less revealing outfit — a lacy black bra and shredded black high-waist shorts. The “Born This Way” singer enjoyed a little down-time at The Abbey before ducking back out onto the street, where fans greeted the singer and snapped photos.</p><p>The next day, the singer wore two separate black ensembles and painted her face a multitude of colors to emulate her “Applause” cover art. Gaga continued her rounds in West Hollywood that night, heading to Micky’s to film a lyric video for her new track on Monday, Aug. 12.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>PHOTOS: Lady Gaga’s craziest VMA looks</a></p><p>“She had a camera with a big light on it the whole time and was filming,” an eyewitness tells <strong>Us</strong>. “She really got into the show and performers, tipping them and doing shots. You almost got the sense that she was turning the whole thing into a piece of performance art.”</p><p>Gaga will be making her much-anticipated return to the stage later this month, her first since undergoing hip surgery in February, and the eccentric singer couldn’t be more excited.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“When I was finishing the [Born This Way] tour, I was physically breaking,” she told <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Ryan Seacrest</strong></a> of the genesis for her new single in a recent interview. “I was in a lot of pain, but didn’t know where really. I have a strong threshold for pain, so I kept slapping myself saying, ‘Get it together.'” Gaga was forced to pull the plug on her tour prematurely after doctors discovered the severity of her injuries; she underwent hip surgery in February.</p><p>“The only thing that kept me going was the applause,” she continued. “And I was able to drown out the pain and finish the show.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6GupcWMoJigmV2buaK%2Fx56qZpqlqcFuwc2dnKuvlZa%2FbrXNZqGer5Wheqa6wqusrKyVmXq0tMSeqWanpamzqsCMqaCcrKWnsrR5kWlobGljbXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
