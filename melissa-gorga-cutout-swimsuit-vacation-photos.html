The 44-year-old rocked a sexy plunging one-piece swimsuit with cutouts on the stomach revealing her toned abs in a new <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram post</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Melissa posted the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>slideshow of photos</a> with the caption, “Letting the natural curls come through like a nice Italian girl#italy #capri #positano.” In the photos, the Real Housewives of New Jersey star wore a strapless ivory one-piece swimsuit with cutouts on the bodice. The cutouts revealed Melissa’s toned abs and tiny waist which were decorated with three roses. The neckline of the high-rise swimsuit was also seriously plunging revealing ample cleavage.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Melissa topped her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>vacation look</a> off with a pair of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>oversized sunglasses</a> and long natural waves that were down and parted in the middle. Melissa posed on a boat alongside her husband, Joe, who rocked a white bathing suit with a loose button-down white short-sleeve shirt which he chose to keep unbuttoned at the top. He topped his look off with a silver dog tag necklace and black aviator sunglasses.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>This swimsuit was one of many <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>sexy looks</a> Melissa has rocked on her Italian vacation and another one of our favorites was her low-cut, scoop-neckline turquoise swimsuit. The ruched one-piece was skintight and she wore a pair of black and white striped high-waisted pants on top. The flowy pants were slit down the front revealing her toned legs and she topped her look off with a blue silk Emilio Puccio scarf wrapped around her head, oversized square sunglasses, nude studded sandals, and a straw Prada beach bag.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Melissa took her sexy vacation looks even further when she showed off her incredibly toned figure in an L Space bikini while taking a dip in the ocean. She opted to wear a purple and red color-blocked two-piece featuring a halterneck scooped top with a pair of matching high-rise bottoms. A white headband and a pair of large white sunglasses tied her look together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH15e49rZqadnJ7AtK2MoKarn5FisLbAzq6rZqunnrq0wcitZK%2BZk5bBqrvNZqehp6SkwHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
