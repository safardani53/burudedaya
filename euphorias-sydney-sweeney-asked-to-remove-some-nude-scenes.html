When I didn’t want to do it, he didn’t make me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Why-Euphorias-Sydney-Sweeney-Asked-to-Cut-Some-of-Her-Characters-Nude-Scenes-2.jpg><p>The Washington native compared this experience to other sets throughout her career where she didn’t feel the ability to “speak up,” saying, “I’ve had experiences where I want to go home and scrub myself completely raw because I feel disgusting. I didn’t feel comfortable with my castmate or the crew, and I just didn’t feel like my character would be doing it.”</p><p>The<a href=#> White Lotus </a>alum has faced “disrespectful and distressing” cyberbullying over her nude scenes, she went on to tell the outlet, noting that there is a “stigma” against female stars who are naked onscreen.</p><p>“When a guy has a sex scene or shows his body, he still wins awards and gets praise. But the moment a girl does it, it’s completely different,” the Everything Sucks! alum said. “I’m very proud of my work in Euphoria. I thought it was a great performance. But no one talks about it because I got naked. I do The White Lotus and all of the sudden, critics are paying attention. People are loving me. They’re going, ‘Oh my God, what’s she doing next?’ I was like, ‘Did you not see that in Euphoria?”</p><p>In May 2021, the Sharp Objects alum took to Instagram Live to respond to haters calling her “ugly” on Twitter.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I think it’s really important for people to see how words actually affect people,” Sweeney in her tearful social media upload at the time. “I know everyone says, ‘You can’t read things,’ and ‘You shouldn’t read things,’ but, like, I’m a f–king person. I’m just sitting here with my dog, Tink, watching HGTV, wearing my Snuggie. People need to be nicer on social media because it’s really f–ked up.”</p><p>The<a href=#> Handmaid’s Tale</a> alum told Collider six months prior that she’s “not … super confident,” saying, “I care what people say and what they think and what they comment, so I definitely am always like, ‘Oh, my God, should I post this?’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJyuqJikv6qt0maqspyemsZuv9aenKedqWKutLfEnWStp12nsq671Z5krKedmnqvwcOeZKyblaOytHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
