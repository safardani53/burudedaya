So who is this hot racer on Team Boddie? Here's everything you need to know about Aleisha and her '68 Camaro rig.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, who is grudge racer Aleisha Beckum?</h2><p>Sacramento-based Aleisha, 28, reps Team Boddie and grudge racing, hard. As Boosted and Big Chief tried to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explain</a> to the rest of the 405, grudge racing means "get ready for 30 minutes to an hour of screaming."&nbsp;</p><p>Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Monsters and Critics</a>, "a grudge racer is a modern-day drag racer who trash-talks and races by strict ground rules while street/track racing." This is probably why the 405 team was having such a hard time keeping track of all the information Boosted and Big Chief were trying to spring upon them.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>According to a recent profile Aleisha received on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Match Race Madness</a>, the 28-year-old has been grudge racing for about a year now and is already making a name for herself on the scene. "Aleisha is paving her own path in the grudge racing world with some serious passes down the 1320," it reads.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>When she isn't grudge racing, Aleisha likes to work on her fundamentals and practice bracket racing. Her best attributes are racing with "NO EGO," and emitting "positive vibes only," per Aleisha's Instagram profile.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Aleisha drives "Blue Balls."</h2><p>No, we're not kidding. Blue Balls is the actual name of Aleisha's '68 Camaro rig. According to Match Race Madness' <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> page, this is not your parents' old Chevy.&nbsp;</p><p>Blue Balls delivers "big-time performances with an AES big-block Chevy nitrous engine," and boasts a "a Power Glide transmission and Mark Williams rear end.‚Äù "Blue Balls looks a little mean," Aleisha recently posted on her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> page.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How long has Team Boddie been around?</h2><p>Team Boddie might be new to Street Outlaw fans, but the team has been around in the drag racing world since the 1960s when brothers Kenny and Ronnie Boddie started racing a 1956 Buick Roadmaster and a black and blue 1968 Camaro in San Francisco's Bay View district.&nbsp;</p><p>Since they got their start, the brothers now have 10 kids between them and have kept the racing legacy going strong in the family. Aleisha races for Jermaine Boddie, who's been a familiar face on Discovery Channel ever since he raced against Birdman of Texas in House of Grudge. He later appeared on Street Outlaws in the 2017 season finale as part of Team Cali.</p><p>Street Outlaws airs Mondays at 9 p.m. on Discovery.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrmmtdKhmGaalZi4trmMrKurnZWperDB06WYsKs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
