Then they left the network and toured to perform shows.</p><p>Following his success as a podcaster, in December of 2016, he released his solo podcast titled Big Brown Breakdown. His podcast mainly focused on topics like combat sports.</p><p>Right from the start, Brendan’s podcast brewed controversies when he suggested that the UFC on Fox panel was selected just for the sake of diversity. His exact words were,</p><p>“Sometimes you look at UFC Tonight, and you’re like, ‘Alright, is that the best panel possible? Or are you just trying to check off the boxed?” We get it; UFC Tonight FOX, you’re not racist. We get it; you have an all-black panel, we get it. Woah, we get it. We get it, man.”</p><p>Moreover, in early 2018, Schaub partnered with Showtime to rebrand his podcast to “BELOW THE BELT with Brendan Schaub.” Following that with Theo Von, the duo announced creating a new podcast titled “King and the Sting.”&nbsp;</p><h3>Stand-up and On-screen Appearances</h3><p>The podcast career was not the only thing that Schaub pursued right after his MMA retirement.
