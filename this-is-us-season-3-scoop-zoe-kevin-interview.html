The couple will continue to navigate the uncharted territories within their relationship as the season continues. “All relationships have challenges, and I just think our past can make us frightened to trust people,” <strong>Melanie Liburd</strong> told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> EXCLUSIVELY at NBC’s midseason press junket in NYC. “She’s had a troubled childhood, and I think Zoe, in the past, shied away from getting too close to people because it’s a bit scary. But with him she really has opened up, and I think it’s all new to her, and it’s just a beautiful love story.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>This Is Us dropped a bombshell on fans earlier in the season by revealing that Nicky didn’t die in Vietnam. He’s very much alive. The discovery has shaken up Kevin, Kate, and Randall. Melanie admitted that Zoe will be there for Kevin as he processes this shocking information. “I think Zoe’s going to be there as much as she can to help support him,” Melanie said. “It’s a real emotional, huge thing that they’ve uncovered, and it’s going to be interesting to see how he deals with it… there’s even more questions and even more answers to get, so it’s really exciting.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Fans will also learn more about Zoe and her cousin, Beth, in the show’s upcoming Beth-centered episode.
