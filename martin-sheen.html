Martin was drawn to acting at a young age, but his father didn’t approve of it. Knowing&nbsp;his dad was against&nbsp;it, Martin decided to try his hand at acting anyway. The actor purposely failed his entrance exam for the University of Dayton so he could pursue his acting career.&nbsp;Martin was able to borrow money from a Catholic priest and moved to NYC in his early twenties. The actor spent two years at the Living Theatre company. Although it wasn’t mentioned when, Martin&nbsp;decided to go by the name “Martin Sheen” in order to advance his acting career. However, the change wasn’t permanent. Martin revealed he still used his birth name on legal documents. Since his name change, Martin has starred and appeared in a number of movies and TV shows. His most notable were in the films&nbsp;Badlands and&nbsp;Apocalypse Now. Looking back at the move, which turned him into a successful movie star, Martin admitted to regret keeping his birth-given name.&nbsp;From 1999 to 2006, he starred as President Josiah Bartlet in&nbsp;The West Wing. Martin was&nbsp;nominated for an Emmy six times for this role and won six of his eight Golden Globe&nbsp;nominations. The actor has also appeared alongside his sons Emilio and Charlie&nbsp;on the big screen.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><span class=celeb_profile_label>Best Known For:</span><br>Martin Sheen is best known for his roles in&nbsp;Apocalypse Now,&nbsp;Badlands, and&nbsp;The West Wing.
