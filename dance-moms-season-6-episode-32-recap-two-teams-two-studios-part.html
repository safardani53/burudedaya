She obviously thought there was no way this day would ever come, so she told the moms to get everyone to make a list of why they hate her.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Holly was very adamant that no one would be making any lists and was quick to point out that Abby was just trying to degrade them some more. Jill even blamed Abby for screwing the kids over at the last competition.&nbsp;</p><p>The moms did have a point. Abby practically pushed the Elites to the side in favor of the Minis. It was bad. She should have been giving both teams enough attention to ensure they were all good.&nbsp;</p><p>Jill then decided to give the girls a pep talk. Basically, all she wanted to do was let the girls know they needed to prove to Abby that they didn’t need her to get further.&nbsp;</p><p>The plan for the Elites to prove Abby wrong started going awry when Kendall pulled a muscle in her neck, making her neck movement restricted.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Ashlee seemed to think she was trying too hard to prove a point and that’s why she’s in this situation.&nbsp;</p><p>Kerri then burst in wailing about the other Mini moms not standing up for her against Abby. The other team then allowed Peyton to perform with the minis.&nbsp;</p><p>Kerry wanted to rub it in Abby’s face, but Abby wished her good luck and moved swiftly on.</p><p>Kerri then focused on trashing the other mini mothers, saying they just follow Abby’s every command and it’s tiring.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>When the Elites performed their solos, Abby said they never performed anything great. Yikes, will she ever shut up?</p><p>She did shut her mouth when Jill asked her what she thought of them.&nbsp;</p><p>The Elite mothers gave their girls some last minute notes and trashed Abby some more.&nbsp;</p><p>The Minis performed very well and Abby was visibly pleased by it.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>When the Elites came in third place, Abby clapped, causing another huge argument. The moms were telling her she was terrible and stuff, but Abby was brutally honest with them.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, the Elites said they were done with the ALDC, but who might replace them for Season 7?</p><p>It’s definitely been a whirlwind season of drama, but what will become of the show?</p><p>Sound off below!</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Abby Lee Miller: The Beast of the East (Coast)</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2puX2Z%2BcLDAp5qeZZ2kurR50p6YrKeeYoNusc%2BiqqiclWKAc3nRnpqaqF2pxLB5056YpqtdqcSwedKtrJ2hn6h6sa3RrWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
