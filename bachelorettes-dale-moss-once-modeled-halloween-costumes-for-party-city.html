In the photos, Moss wears a superman costume with fake muscles. In another picture, he portrays a Roman Centurion. The last snapshot features Moss as a taco alongside a dog in a matching costume. The South Dakota native was also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted</a> on a bag of photo props holding up a sign that reads “Hubby.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Bachelorette-Frontrunner-Dale-Moss-Once-Modeled-Halloween-Costumes-for-Party-City-Inline-01.jpg><p>Earlier this year, Moss told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Midco Sports Network</a> that he hoped to have a career like Ryan Seacrest.</p><p>“Currently, I am a model with Wilhelmina International, and a sports and entertainment host,” he said at the time. “That’s always been one of my focuses. I think how Ryan Seacrest has built a brand and really an empire is really amazing, and I would love to model my career after him.”</p><p>Moss <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sparked an instant connection</a> with Crawley, 39, on The Bachelorette season premiere, which was filmed over the summer and aired earlier this month. The hairstylist even declared that she had just met her “husband” after being introduced to Moss on the first night.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Bachelorette-Frontrunner-Dale-Moss-Once-Modeled-Halloween-Costumes-for-Party-City.jpg><p>Us Weekly confirmed in August that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Crawley exited the show</a> early <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">after finding love</a> with one of her suitors. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tayshia Adams</strong></a> is expected to take over the lead to go on her own journey of love.</p><p>Crawley told Us on October 14 that she didn’t understand why people would <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">criticize her for falling in love so quickly.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“My question would be to the people that are saying that — to the people that question it — what exactly is the formula for falling in love? Is there one way to do it? Is there one example of this is how it’s done?” she asked Us. “Who are these people to decide how long it takes somebody to fall in love? Is it a week? Is it a month? Is it a year? Is it two years? How people fall in love and the amount of time that it happens or what the process is [changes]. It’s not for anybody to really decide if there is a cookie cutter for that.”</p><p>The Bachelorette airs on ABC Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabmZOdsq270Z6rrZ2jYrGiuMRmpKiro2K8r6%2FEZqSonJWhsqV5x5qjpaenmrKvecKoqq2tnZrAbrLOq2SpmaKpxm6vyK2waA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
