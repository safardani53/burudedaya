There isn’t a sunscreen than can guarantee 100 per cent protection.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>ABC Australia</a> reported that if your unprotected skin takes 10 minutes to show signs of burning, then properly applying factor 50 would make the rate of burning 50 times longer (so 500 minutes/more than eight hours).</p><p>Factor 30 would be 30 minutes longer (300 minutes/five hours); and factor 15 would be therefore take 150 minutes (an hour and a half) longer to show signs of burning.</p><p>But in the real world, you'll likely burn if you don't reapply your sun cream repeatedly for hours on end.</p><p>It is advisable to top-up your sun cream every couple of hours when in the sun.</p><p>You should also reapply after you have been in water, even if your sunscreen is "water resistant", after towel drying, sweating and when it may have rubbed off.</p><h2>Can I get a tan in the shade?</h2><p>Yes, <a href=#>tanning in the shade</a> is possible.</p><p>The sun reflects off objects in the environment and on to skin.</p><p>Certain environmental factors, such as bright snow or pale beach sand, can reflect the sun’s rays to your skin, even while sitting in the shade.</p><p>Experts from <a href=# rel=noopener>Queensland University of Technology</a> said sand can reflect as much as 25 per cent of UV radiation.</p><p>That's why the professionals at skincancer.org have said that while shade is a potentially valuable means of protection from the damaging effects of the sun’s UV rays, not all shade is equally protective.</p><p>They also go on to say that people can spend long hours in the shade while still receiving quite a lot of sun exposure and risking skin damage.</p><p>UVB rays, often considered the most harmful part of sunlight, can reach the skin indirectly.</p><p>So <a href=#>even if you're not directly in the sun</a>, you still need to wear a sunscreen with an SPF factor in it, even when you are not actively <a href=#>tanning</a>.</p><p>See our expert's <a href=#>top tips for getting the perfect tan safely</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqGcmqSknXx3gpFyb2tvX6mur3nSrqVmq6CbgnF505qlZquYlrGmew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
