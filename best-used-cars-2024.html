Merced</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>THESE are the best used cars that you can pick up for under £10,000 in 2024 - including a sporty Mazda and a budget-friendly Mercedes.</p><p>The list, compiled by experts at vehicle sales site <a href=# aria-label="Motors (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Motors</a>, provides drivers with plenty of options, from <a href=#>SUVs</a> to hatchbacks, amid the <a href=#>cost of living</a> crisis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/newspress-collage-lx25xncct-1704285307333.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mini Countryman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/motor-car-mini-cooper-countryman-869561942.jpg><p><a href=#>Mini's</a> take on a chunkier SUV line, the Countryman is an ideal runaround.</p><p>Its retro styling gives it an old-school feel, though buyers should be aware it is a little smaller than some of its rivals.</p><p>Nonetheless, if you don't need all that much storage space, its perfect as an upsized version of the beloved Mini range.</p><p>The model received a facelift in 2014 which updated its exterior, but versions from before that can sell for as little as £4,000.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE MOTORS NEWS">READ MORE MOTORS NEWS</h2><p>Look out for the ALL4 badge for the <a href=#>four-wheel drive</a> version, though these tend to be a little pricier.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kia Picanto</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2005-blue-kia-picanto-car-869562097.jpg><p>The third generation Picanto, so those made after 2017, made its name as a reliable and affordable city car.</p><p>Its "compact" size makes it a cinch to <a href=#>park</a> in tight spaces and its simple design and control set-up make it great for beginners and experienced drivers alike.</p><p>They also come with a transferable seven-year warranty, which will only run out on the earliest models this year.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Motors</h2></p><p>Those looking for a bit more <a href=#>tech</a> and power can opt for the Picanto 2, which still won't break the bank.</p><p>Older models start from around £7,000.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>FIAT 500</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/500-parked-street-malmoe-869562145.jpg><p>A favourite of British drivers for decades, the 500 is renowned for its quirky appearance and <a href=#>zippy nature</a>.</p><p>It even features a dedicated city <a href=#>button</a> which lightens the steering, making it more manoeuvrable on packed roads.</p><p>Prices bottom out at just under £4,000 but taller drivers may struggle with the car's limited space.</p><p>500s also don't have quite the same track record on reliability as some of <a href=#>Fiat's</a> other models, with some drivers reporting issues with build quality.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Nissan Qashqai</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2013-test-drive-nissan-crossover-869562179.jpg><p>Back to the bigger models we go with the Qashqai SUV.</p><p>Versions going back to 2014 fit well under the budget, with the cheapest coming out around £6,000.</p><p>There's plenty of room for passengers and in the boot, while <a href=#>Nissan</a> also offers an <a href=#>automatic</a> version.</p><p>One maintenance quirk to bear in mind is that some owners have reported unusually fast oil consumption in older 1.2-litre variants, so it's best to keep a close eye on your dipstick if you pick one up.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mazda MX-5</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2019-red-open-top-mazda-869561146.jpg><p>The MX-5 is <a href=#>Mazda's</a> flagship model and has a great reputation amongst enthusiasts for both its hardy reliability and silky smooth drive quality.</p><p>It's also a convertible, with a simple roof design that's easily mastered, adding a bit of extra style.</p><p>The third generation, from 2005-2015, will keep you under budget, but very early versions could run into issues with <a href=#>ULEZ</a> or <a href=#>CAZ</a> charges so if your city has environmental restrictions be sure to check first.</p><p>Also just be vigilant for cheap offerings which have been driven hard by petrolhead owners.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Toyota Prius</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2009-silver-hybrid-electric-toyota-869562201.jpg><p>No <a href=#>environmental</a> worries here as the Prius is one of the UK's most popular <a href=#>hybrids</a>.</p><p>They are loved by private taxi drivers for a reason, as they are low maintenance, cheap to run and happy to eat up the miles.</p><p>However, the other side of this coin is that most second-hand offerings tend to be quite high mileage.</p><p>The best prices sit somewhere around the £5,000 mark.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kia Sportage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2019-red-diesel-engine-kia-869561415.jpg><p>The 2016-2021 fourth-generation Sportage takes the spotlight here as it provides the most up-to-date styling and gadgets for the best price.</p><p>Its main advantages are the large amount of space it provides and the wide range of engine types available.</p><p>Post-2016 models also mean that you are generally safe on environmental regulations for <a href=#>diesel</a> versions.</p><p>These also benefit from <a href=#>Kia's</a> seven-year warranty.</p><p>Many sit around the £15,000 range but they can still be picked up for £7,000-£8,000 at the bottom end.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Seat Leon</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2013-first-drive-new-seat-869561586.jpg><p>As a good mid-sized hatchback, the Leon offers a bit of a middle ground between the earlier entries on the list.</p><p>Manoeuvrable around the city while providing a little more space than the smaller Picanto, for example, its closest rival is the <a href=#>VW Golf</a>.</p><p>Third-generation models from 2013-20 boast a good reliability reputation and are generally cheaper than the competition, especially when running the three-cylinder engine.</p><p>Some can be picked up for as little as £3,000 but £5,000-£6,000 is more standard territory.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Skoda Octavia</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2023-blue-skoda-octavia-hybrid-869562272.jpg><p>Another one to target from 2013-20 is the Octavia, which offers a pretty similar package to the Leon.</p><p>Both sell for well under the budget and offer a wide variety if engines.</p><p>The Octavia just edges things when it comes to boot space, boasting a very roomy rear compartment.</p><p>It also offers an auto version, though these have been reported to see some <a href=#>transmission</a> issues so check service histories where possible.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Mercedes B-Class</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/w245-b-class-drives-city-869561665.jpg><p>The <a href=#>Mercedes</a> name always carries with it certain expectations when it comes to build quality and reliability.</p><p>The B-Class MPV makes good on those promises for quite a significant price cut on the rest of the manufacturer's catalogue.</p><p>Bottoming out at around £6,000, they are near the higher end of the budget but offer a great amount of tech, excellent comfort and great drive quality.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>You can even pick up a sportier AMG version for a little more.</p><p>However, the great price is counterbalanced by the fact that service costs can be higher than other Merc models.</p><p class=postsid
