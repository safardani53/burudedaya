f</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>A MOTORS expert has revealed a list of the best cars you can buy for under £2,000 that won't guzzle all your fuel.</p><p>JB, from CarswithJB on <a href=#>YouTube</a>, posted a video running down a range of cheap and cheerful rides that you can enjoy on a budget.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/63914065-cde4-4a9e-8c7c-42c4fa8c3a1e.jpg><p>As the <a href=#>cost of living</a> crisis bites and <a href=#>petrol prices</a> soar with <a href=#>inflation</a>, JB's advice couldn't come at a better time.</p><h2>Renault Clio</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/new-renault-clio-parked-grobnik-810122493.jpg><p>First up, he recommended the much-loved family classic <a href=#>Renault</a> Clio.</p><p>The 1.2-litre inline-four is not as thirsty as many other <a href=#>hatchbacks</a>, while it can still get you where you need to go with a 0-60 time of 10.6 seconds.</p><p>JB said: "It's the joint-quickest car on the list but, despite that, it will still manage 51 miles per gallon (mpg) and costs £135 per year in road tax.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE MOTORS NEWS">READ MORE MOTORS NEWS</h2><p>"This is the perfect first car, but it can substitute as a family hatch instead, given it's not too small in size."</p><p>Within the budget, drivers should target the third-generation models, starting at around £1,800 online.</p><h2>Fiat Grande Punto</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/100-cars-sale-sunmotors-co-144573451.jpg><p>With a similar engine to the Renault, the <a href=#>Fiat</a> is a few seconds off the pace, but slightly more economical at 52 mpg.</p><p>It is also identical in its <a href=#>road tax</a> expense so is still good value all round.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Motors</h2></p><p>JB added: "One strange fact about these is that, on release, they had the highest level of safety standards...but when they were retested in 2012, they go zero stars."</p><p>He suggested this was likely due to a lack of updates on the <a href=#>safety features</a> between the car's 2005 debut and its retest seven years on.</p><p>The Grande Punto is available for around £1,500, while high-mileage but more recent examples clock in at £2,000.</p><p>However, JB warned that issues with "build quality" could lead to some dangerous flaws, including steering failure.</p><h2>Mini Hatch</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/front-view-white-mini-cooper-820655468.jpg><p>The <a href=#>Mini</a> Hatch ties the Clio for pace and comes with its unique British heritage.</p><p>Earlier models can be found online for as little as £1,000, though these are likely to be high-mileage.</p><p>JB explained: "It's quoted as doing 53 mpg...I can attest to them being very solid little <a href=#>cars</a>.</p><p>"The only negative is them being four-seaters, rather than five, so slightly less practical.</p><p>"But, I would consider it to be amongst the nicest of the cars on the list and if you find a first example it's even more economical."</p><h2>Skoda Citigo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/skoda-citigoe-iv-620870393.jpg><p>A slightly smaller engine powers the Citigo, with a titchy 1-litre inline-three putting out a 0-60 time of 13.9 seconds.</p><p>It's more expensive on the <a href=#>tax</a> side, too, with an annual bill of £165, but is more economical than the previous options, at 55mpg.</p><p>JB said: "It's not my cup of tea due to how small it is, and I'd maybe only recommend it as a city car that's focussed on short journeys.</p><p>"But I do like how basic it is, with all the amenities you need as a driver, nothing more, nothing less."</p><p>It is also more expensive at purchase, with basic models sneaking in just under the £2,000 cap online.</p><h2>Ford KA</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/sun-sunday-motors-nicks-picks-339913884.jpg><p>Back to the inline-fours, the <a href=#>Ford</a> is still a touch sluggish, reaching 60mph in 13 seconds.</p><p>However, in terms of running costs, it's a steal, with a tax bill of just £30 and a 57 mpg economy rate.</p><p>JB said that the model's shared development with the <a href=#>Fiat 500</a> led to common issues, including engine problems and corrosion.</p><p>Meanwhile, initial purchase costs are high, with a starting price right on the £2,000 line.</p><h2>Kia Picanto</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ask-alfie-pics-sunday-motors-709167304.jpg><p>The slowest car on the list, with a 0-60 of just 14.6 seconds.</p><p>However, again it is just £30 for the tax and its economy is a generous 58mpg.</p><p>It was initially marketed by <a href=#>rallying</a> legend Marcus Granholm but JB said it drives more like a city car.</p><p>Basic models are available for around £1,000, with plenty of options under £2,000.</p><h2>Peugeot 107</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/21953f8f-e27e-46e5-aecb-eb93a05e43ae.jpg><p>JB perhaps summed this model up best when he said: "I had to bring back the Peugeot 107 into this vide, given how incredible the running costs really are."</p><p>And incredible they are, costing only £20 in tax and doing a whopping 61mpg.</p><p>He added that the <a href=#>Toyota</a> engine under the <a href=#>Peugeot</a> shell is "renowned for its reliability", but did cite issues around boot space and water leakage.</p><p>Still for just £1,000 at the bottom end, many will consider this a great deal.</p><h2>Hyundai I10</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000814414738.jpg><p>Back on the quicker side, with a 0-60 of 11.8 seconds, the <a href=#>Hyundai</a>, like the Peugeot, is £20 for the year's worth of tax and manages 61 mpg.</p><p>JB said: "This is the sister car to the Kia Picanto we mentioned before.</p><p>"Though they are very cheap feeling, they are the definition of cheap and cheerful."</p><p>Although, they do start at the limit of £2,000 so are on the more expensive end of the list.</p><h2>Nissan Pixo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nicks-picks-hatchbacks-336653324.jpg><p>The Pixo is another slower option, but manages a list-topping 65mpg and still only costs £20 in road tax.</p><p>JB said: "What made the Pixo famous for me was its appearance on <a href=#>Top Gear</a>."</p><p>They clock in at a minimum of £1,500, with 2010 models at £2,000.</p><h2>Suzuki Alto</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/NINTCHDBPICT000344415954.jpg><p>A sister car of the Pixo, sharing the same frame and drivetrain, the Suzuki just edges it out as it's 0.5 of a second quicker, with the same excellent economy.</p><p>JB revealed that it was originally designed for the <a href=#>Indian</a> market but came over to <a href=#>Europe</a> shortly after.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>It was even built in response to rising prices after the <a href=#>2008 financial crisis</a>, making it ideal for today's tough times.</p><p>The Alto is available online for around £1,900 but is a bargain considering its affordability in terms of running costs.</p><p
