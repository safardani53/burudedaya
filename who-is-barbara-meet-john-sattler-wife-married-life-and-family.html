Meet John Sattler Wife: Married Life And Family</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p><strong>Barbara Sattler</strong>, <strong>John Sattler’s wife</strong>, has recently been a source of worry after the death of the professional and national representative rugby league player. John Sattler was a rugby league professional and national representative. In the 1960s and 1970s, he was a fantastic player.&nbsp;John was also a tough Prop forward and the captain of his side, South Sydney. So, from 1967 to 1971, the professional rugby league player captained his side to four premiership titles. Similarly, he played four Tests for Australia, including three as national captain. The player was a hard man in Australian rugby league.&nbsp;Furthermore, his playing ability was a fan favorite, and John was an aggressive on-field player. Nonetheless, he was a very different guy off the field than he was on the field.</p><h2>Who Is John Sattler’s Wife Barbara?</h2><p>John Sattler died at the age of 80, and the rugby world extends heartfelt condolences to his family members.&nbsp;In addition, John was a married guy, a loving, caring husband, and a father of two children. However, since he was more focused on his job, there is little information about his wife and children. Sattler’s wife’s name is Barbara, and he has two children called Lisa and Scott. There have been several inquiries regarding his wife and children, but nothing more can be located at this time.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/John-Sattler-1.jpg alt="John Sattler" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Nonetheless, we know that his son, Scott, was a professional rugby league player who won the national premiership with the Penrith Panthers in 2003. Aside from his wife and daughter’s names, further information about them, including their professional and personal lives, has to be included so that more data may become available in the future.</p><h2>John Sattler Family</h2><p><strong>John Sattler</strong>, born on July 28, 1942, was a talented rugby league player. But he’s never revealed anything about his childhood.&nbsp;In addition, his parents’ identities are yet unknown. Nothing is known about John’s parents or family, nor is there much information about his childhood. Given his outstanding playing career, he must have had a strong interest in rugby from his childhood.&nbsp;Before making his professional debut in 1959, John must have participated in several local tournaments and matches throughout his school and college career.&nbsp;Unlike his sporting career, Sattler was extremely quiet about his professional career, thus die-hard supporters and rugby fans seldom saw John with his family throughout his busy years.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/John-Sattler-2.jpg alt="John Sattler" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>John Sattler’s Net Worth in 2023</h2><p>As we all know, <strong>John Sattler</strong> had a lengthy professional rugby career, playing football from 1959 to 1973.
