There's Arlene Chua, a bakery owner and teacher from Staten Island. From Louisiana, there's Rebecca Duggar who loves Halloween as much as she loves nerdy bakes. Kim Fink hails from California and loves "scary or cute things" made into "edible desserts." Lastly, there's Joshua Juarez from Austin who loves baking for dogs.</p><p>Together, these bakers will participate in different weekly challenges to see who can come up with the spookiest and tastiest Halloween cookies ever. Each new challenge tests the bakers skills with certain ingredients as well as the creativity in their bakes. And what baking competition would be worth the effort without a terrifyingly tantalizing cash prize at the end?
