Visuals that popped into my mind and piqued my curiosity,” the singer explained. “Stars drawn around scars. A cardigan that still bears the scent of loss 20 years later. Battleships sinking into the ocean, down, down, down. The tree swing in the woods of my childhood. … Pretty soon these images in my head grew faces or names and became characters. I found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing about or from the perspective of people I’ve never met, people I’ve known, or those I wish I hadn’t.”</p><p>Swift noted that the “lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and fiction become almost indiscernible” in folklores.</p><p>“In isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result,” she wrote. “Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history and memory. I’d told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love, wonder and whimsey they deserve.”</p><p>Swift concluded that the stories were up to her fans to pass on — <a href=#>and they have happily accepted the job.</a> She also gave them more insight into her writing process during a live chat on YouTube as the<a href=#> “Cardigan” video</a> premiered on July 24.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“One thing I did purposely on this album was put the Easter eggs in the lyrics, more than just the videos,” Swift wrote. “I created character arcs & recurring themes that map out who is singing about who.”</p><p>Scroll through for a breakdown of the lyrics and theories for every song from <a href=#>Folklore</a>:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bprrq4zqtkrK%2BZm8G0ecWoo6Skn6eybrDEnKadoZ6cerW0xGajsqqZmMBuscCsq56qXZq0qL%2BMrZ%2Bep6KesrR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
