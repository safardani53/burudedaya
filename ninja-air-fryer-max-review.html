We were pleasantly surprised with the time, as at first we thought this might not be long enough.</p><p>The end result had all the tastiness, crunch and satisfying quality of chips - no empty feeling of healthy substitutes but it was satisfying to know we hadn’t just dunked them in oil.</p><p>We've made these multiple times since first giving it a whirl, and we’ve found the bigger chips performed better as there was more space for the air to circulate.<br></p><h2>Extra Features</h2><p>There's also a number of extra functions that are perfect for cooks.</p><p>Frozen food can be cooked with the Air Max function, so think perfectly cooked nuggets, frozen chips, all with a super crunchy skin, and soft middle.</p><p>Bakers can even bake cakes in there - but make sure you check the instructions first - you don't want mix going through the basket holes - not to mention there's also roast, and dehydrate if you fancy something a bit different.</p><p>However, whilst these extra functions are great, the chance of you using them as often are small - therefore we did wonder when cooking for two whether we would be better off with less features and a smaller machine.</p><h2>The verdict</h2><p>For those looking for an easy, quick and tasty solution for at home frying, the Ninja Air Fryer is worth checking out.</p><p>In hindsight we would have gone with a smaller model, but any home cook will be pleased with the range on offer.</p><p>At £129.99 it isn’t super cheap, but if you use it regularly it’s worth the cash.</p><p>Whether you’re a couple, or feeding a larger household it produced some of the best home cooked chips we’ve tried in a long time.</p><p>For fakeaway fans, this is one for you.</p><ul><li><strong>Ninja Air Max Fryer, £129.99, Currys and Ninja.co.uk- <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">buy here&nbsp;</a></strong></li></ul><p>All prices in this article were correct at the time of writing, but may have since changed.
