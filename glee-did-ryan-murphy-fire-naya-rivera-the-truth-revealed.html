This came as no surprise, as&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife.com&nbsp;</strong>previously reported that <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Naya&nbsp;was pulled out of the episode</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><span>“The rumors of Naya being written off the finale are definitely true,” a&nbsp;Glee insider told us EXCLUSIVELY, after we found out that Naya got into an argument with a producer.&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-4>We caught up with <strong>Jane Lynch&nbsp;</strong>who told us about next season’s cast, and now show creator Ryan Murphy is speaking out, too.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5><span>“I don’t think there is a story between Naya and Leah. I always marvel at the things that become headline news that most of the time are completely fabricated,” Ryan told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Extra</a>, saying&nbsp;that she is&nbsp;not&nbsp;fired. “Naya’s coming back next year, Lea’s coming back next year, anybody ever in that cast has an open invitation to come back and finish the character they so beautifully started.”</span></p><h3>Naya Rivera Is&nbsp;Off ‘Glee’ — Ryan Murphy Has Not Asked Her Back</h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>Despite Ryan’s denial of Naya being kicked off,&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife.com</strong>&nbsp;has EXCLUSIVELY learned that Ryan was just playing coy, and that Naya is indeed off the show!</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“He had to make that statement to make it look like he wasn’t taking sides because he doesn’t want to look like the bad guy,” our source tells us. “But at the end of the day Ryan, is in Lea’s [Michele] pocket and she will get whatever she wants.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>As we’ve previously reported, Naya’s involvement with the show has nothing to do with a Lea&nbsp;fight.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>“Naya is gone from the show, but Ryan doesn’t want a feud to take over the last season of the show so he is looking for time to pass and maybe them respecting each other again to make Naya return,” our source continues. The sixth and final season is being held until 2015, which is&nbsp;unusual for a hit show so the network could be taking time to figure things out.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>“Will they share scenes if Naya comes back? Most likely not a chance in hell, but he wants to keep the door open,” says our source. “But as of right now, Naya is gone and she isn’t coming back.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, do you think that Naya is fired from&nbsp;Glee? Should she be fired? Will you watch the show without her?
