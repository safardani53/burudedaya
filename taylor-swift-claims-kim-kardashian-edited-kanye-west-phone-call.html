I went down really, really hard.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Taylor-Lautner-Taylor-Swift-Kanye-West-vma-shutter-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>In 2016, Ye released his single “Famous,” which features a diss at Taylor in the lyric, “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? / I made that bitch famous.” At the time, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>he claimed</a> that he had received permission from Taylor to include the lyric. However, the “Look What You Made Me Do” artist made it clear that this wasn’t the case. Kim, 43, then claimed that Taylor gave Ye the go-ahead with the final lyric.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-7>After the back-and-forth between Kim and Ye and Taylor, the “Stronger” rapper dropped the music video for “Famous,” which featured naked sculptures of Kim and Taylor sleeping next to him in a bed. Later that year, Kim released a video via Snapchat of Ye talking to Taylor on the phone while he was writing the song.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>At one point in the footage, Taylor was heard noting, “I never would’ve expected you to like tell me about a line in your song. I mean, I don’t think anybody would listen to that and be like, ‘Oh, that’s a real diss.’ You gotta tell the story that way that it happened to you and the way you experienced it.” Later in Kim’s recording, Taylor was heard saying, “If people ask me about it, look, I think it would be great for me to be like, ‘He called me and told me before it came out … Joke’s on you, guys. We’re fine.’”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Taylor, however, doubled down on the fact that she didn’t approve the line, “I made that bitch famous.” Nevertheless, countless “cancel Taylor” hashtags and tweets went viral at the time, and many fans took Ye and Kim’s side in the situation.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-10>After the <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>full transcript</a> from the phone call surfaced online, many Swifties came to Taylor’s defense by pointing out that there were several parts of their conversation that weren’t heard. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Taylor, Kim and Ye’s feud</a> dragged on for years, as both sides continued to stand by their own claims.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze49vZq2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF2YuaK1zKxkpKGdYriivsOaqqGhkaN6prDIrZydZZuWu7qxjLCcrKxdpbWwusRmmpqknGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
