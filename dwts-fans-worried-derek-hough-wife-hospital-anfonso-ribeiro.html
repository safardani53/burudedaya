Please know that I am reading every message but need to keep my focus on my daughter's healing."</p><p>Her post continued: "We are asking that you continue to pray because it's working! She started talking to us mid-day and I don't think I have ever been so relieved in my life.</p><p>"She's a strong and mighty little thing and she's got this. Please keep Derek in your prayers as well. His heart is hurting so much."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>MORE ON HER DIAGNOSIS</h2><p>A cranial hematoma, or intracranial hematoma, is a "collection of blood within the skull," according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>.</p><p>"It is usually caused by a blood vessel that bursts in the brain."</p><p>The website went on to say that the condition can be caused by trauma or a fall.</p><p>Some symptoms include headaches, dizziness, confusion, slurred speech, and vomiting.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cedars-Sinai</a>&nbsp;classifies a craniectomy as a "surgery to remove a portion of someone's skull to relieve extra pressure on the brain."</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>AWFUL SITUATION</h2><p>This isn't the first time Hayley has been put in a scary situation.</p><p>In December 2022, it was revealed that Derek and her got into a "pretty scary car accident."</p><p>On Instagram, the couple shared a statement: "On December 12, Derek and I got into a pretty scary car accident in the mountains."</p><p>"Our accident involved a steep hill, icy roads, a tree, and worst of all, the fear that we would slide off the mountain."</p><p>Hayley shared videos and photos of fire trucks coming to their rescue and photos of Hayley in the <a href=#>hospital</a> with cuts and scrapes on her face.</p><p>"Given the circumstances, we have so much to be grateful for.
