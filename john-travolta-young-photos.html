His rise to fame began in the groovy 1970s, where he made a name for himself on the small screen in the hit sitcom Welcome Back, Kotter, pictured in his headshot here. But it was his roles in the box office hits Carrie, Saturday Night Fever, <a href=#>Grease</a>, and Urban Cowboy that cemented his status as a bona fide movie star.</p><p>Although his career hit a bit of a slump in the 80s, John made a comeback in the 90s, thanks to his unforgettable role in the cult classic Pulp Fiction. From there, he continued to captivate audiences in films such as Get Shorty, Broken Arrow, Phenomenon, Face/Off, and A Civil Action. He even showcased his musical talents in the movie-turned-musical Hairspray and the animated hit Bolt. With that many hits, it’s no wonder that John has been recognized for his acting chops. His mantle features a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture, and he can boast nominations for an Academy Award, an Emmy, and several other Golden Globe Awards.</p><p>In addition to his acting career, John is also a singer-songwriter who has released nine albums. He even topped the charts with the Grease soundtrack, which is one of the highest-grossing movie musicals of all time. When he’s not entertaining, the seasoned aviator enjoys soaring through the skies as a private pilot.</p><p>John Travolta has truly done it all, and we can’t wait to see what he’ll do next.
