And the cast is dealing with, just, so much baggage.</p><p>One of the central issues is Shep Rose and Taylor Ann Green’s breakup. That split had a butterfly effect. And there are lingering, unresolved hurts.</p><p>At Madison Lecroy’s wedding afterparty (she’s married, remember?), Taylor confronted Craig Conover. Basically, she felt like Craig treated Shep’s cheating like a joke. That he treated her like a joke.</p><p>The result was that Craig ended up more or less screaming at Taylor. He thinks that she’s angry at the wrong person. Is she?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/0915_southerncharm_26_tayloranngreen_craigconover-1024x576.png><p>Obviously, so much went down on the Southern Charm Season 9 premiere.</p><p>And that was before they even arrived at Madison Lecroy’s friend’s home. Brittany opened the doors of her sprawling home to guests and to production, to film Madison’s wedding afterparty.</p><p>And then plenty happened at the party itself before Taylor and Craig faced off.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/0915_southerncharm_03_craigconover-1024x576.png><p>But the true meat of the premiere was when Taylor, after speaking to Shep Rose (awkwardly) and getting support from Austen Kroll, spoke to Craig.</p><p>“I will say, from my perspective, the way that you approached our breakup was really shitty,” she told Craig.</p><p>Shep had been trying to get Craig and Austen to leave with him to avoid just such a confrontation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/0915_southerncharm_04_paigedesorbo-1024x576.png><p>“We used to be friends,” Taylor told him.</p><p>“I haven’t heard from you,” she said. Others, in contrast, had reached out.</p><p>“You didn’t even talk to me,” a very hurt Taylor told him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/0915_southerncharm_05_madisonlecroy-1024x576.png><p>Last year, we heard all about Taylor and Shep’s breakup.</p><p>She accused him of cheating on her with a string of different women.</p><p>Shep objected to that characterization. He wasn’t saying that he didn’t cheat. Just, in his mind, he didn’t mean to — he wasn’t calling women to come over when she wasn’t there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/0915_southerncharm_07_austenkroll-1024x576.png><p>That is a distinction … but doesn’t change what he did to her.</p><p>Anyway, Taylor noted that she had received support from surprising sources. She’s never been besties with Madison, but Madison messaged her after the split.</p><p>Meanwhile, Craig didn’t even check in. That hurt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/0915_southerncharm_06_madisonlecroy-1024x576.png><p>“You called Austen and laughed about Shep trying to cheat on me,” Taylor accused.</p><p>She grew tearful as the conversation continued.</p><p>“You laughed about it,” she reiterated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/0915_southerncharm_08_tayloranngreen_oliviaflowers-1024x576.png><p>Craig didn’t feel like this was a fair characterization. He also denied laughing over the cheating (though perhaps he did laugh at Shep in some capacity).</p><p>Instead, he claimed that he actually “stopped” Shep from kissing another woman.</p><p>According to him, he sat Shep down in an effort to get the guy to snap out of it. (Shep, it seems, does not remember some of his cheating … which is a whole other problem)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/0915_southerncharm_10_tayloranngreen-1024x576.png><p>But Craig apparently saw this as some sort of bro code issue.</p><p>In his mind, Taylor was his “friends’ girlfriend” and so he couldn’t “go behind his back” and rat him out to Taylor.</p><p>“The girls have had my back … the only guy who’s had my back is Austen,” Taylor noted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/0915_southerncharm_11_sheprose-1024x576.png><p>Basically, Craig felt like his closer friendship with Shep and some sort of weird gender divide meant hat he couldn’t be a better friend to Taylor.</p><p>Meanwhile, Taylor clearly feels like she was essentially a joke. She feels like a fool because of Shep’s cheating, and worries that other people in the group see her the same way.</p><p>It’s a complex, painful situation. And it didn’t need to happen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/0915_southerncharm_12_craigconover_sheprose-1024x576.png><p>“You weren’t there the night he did it,” Craig said growing defensive.</p><p>“I threw him through a f–king wall,” he then yelled. Madison’s party didn’t really need this intense discussion.</p><p>“Screw you,” Craig spat. “I didn’t cheat on you my f–king friend did.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/0915_southerncharm_25_levabonaparte_tayloranngreen_craigconover-1024x576.png><p>Then, Taylor took this to a weird place.</p><p>“What about your girl cheating on you?” she asked as he walked off. Does she mean Paige DeSorbo?</p><p>Ignoring her, Craig fired back: “You’re embarrassing yourself.” He’s certainly right about that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/09/0915_southerncharm_21_brettrandle_madisonlecroy_tayloranngreen-1024x576.png><p>Obviously, Taylor is in a lot of pain. She did embarrass herself, and it wasn’t all about Shep or Craig, either.</p><p>Just a little etiquette reminder: check with someone before you gift them a vibrator. Especially at a public party. Even if you’re not on camera.</p><p>They can be wonderful gifts! But literally just check first. Maybe have a public gift and a private gift if that’s what they need. Come on, girl. Get it together.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2WGcMDAsqOoql2Wu695xqucnqZdlrulecKrmKKfXZi8r7vVnqlmm5yWwKl5zqdkrKelqbWmvs1mmqGZoqJ6tLHArKanZWlivbOxzKKcq51dp7Kkrc9o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
