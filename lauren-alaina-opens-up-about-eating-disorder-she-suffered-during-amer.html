Alaina recalled being “between a teenager and a woman” while a 16-year-old on the show, and marveled at how so many viewers focused on and criticized her body.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Lauren-Alaina-Suffered-From-Eating-Disorder-on-American-Idol-Despite-Feeling-Confident-on-Stage-390.jpg><p>“People commented a lot on my weight. … What kind of evil humans can comment on a 16-year-old child is beyond me now. But as that 16-year-old child it got very bad for a while,” Alaina admitted. “I suffered with such a severe eating disorder in those years where nothing was connecting, it wasn’t only because [I needed] to work hard, I lost who I was completely. Everything, my light like it was dimmed quite a bit because of the TV aspect.”</p><p>Alaina remembered there was even a blog at the time, which she did not name, that photoshopped a “pig nose” on her face and referred to her as “Miss Piggy.” Still, despite the hurtful comments, Alaina managed to also feel good about her fan-favorite performances on the show.</p><p>“It was an extreme high and an extreme low and I got sick … I struggled very, very bad with bulimia for a very long time,” she confessed. “In fact when I was going on <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a> [in 2019,] I had been in remission for years at that point. And something about knowing I was going back on national television I had to <a href=#>start going to therapy</a> for it again.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Alaina says she’s currently doing “great” as she continues to release new music and tour while feeling “happy and healthy.” While she usually stays away from reading comments online, she does look at the ones that are “really great” and interacts with her fans. She says that today, “things are very positive.” now.</p><p>If you or someone you know struggles with an eating disorder, visit the <a href=#>National Association of Anorexia Nervosa & Associated Disorders (ANAD) website</a> or call their hotline at (888)-375-7767 to get help.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGalmaWnsq95wKWYoqaRYryxsc2sZK6oXZavsMHTZpyarJmjtG6wyKymq5yVp3q0tMRmqq6elpq%2FprCMnayroZ6ceqK5xKtm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
