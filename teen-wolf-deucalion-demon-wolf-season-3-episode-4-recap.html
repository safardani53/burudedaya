You might wonder how it’s possible that not a single person saw this happen, but then you remember this is Teen Wolf. Are we still holding onto reality?</p><h3>Isaac & Allison?</h3><p id=content-paragraph-6>This week’s episode also introduced the concept of Isaac and Allison (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Crystal Reed</strong></a>) as a potential couple, and I’m really not sure how I’m supposed to feel. I’m glad they don’t hate each other anymore, and it was fun watching them get all flirty in detention, but like I’ve said in previous recaps, I’m a purist. Allison belongs with Scott (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Tyler Posey</strong></a>) and that’s all there is to it.</p><h3>Another One Bites The Dust</h3><p id=content-paragraph-7>Actually, make that three! Besides the body the kids found during gym class, Lydia (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Holland Roden</strong></a>) also used her&nbsp;still-unexplained power of corpse magnetism to find a second victim: the music teacher. And then there’s Mr. Harris, who was seen tied to a tree and begging for his life at the end of the episode.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>“I did what you asked!” he screamed, but whoever he was talking to had negative f***s to give, and ended up killing him anyway. (Bye, Mr. Harris!)</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>What do we think, gang? If it’s not one of the new Alphas, who&nbsp;is&nbsp;killing off all these humans?</p><h3>Odds & Ends</h3><p id=content-paragraph-10>1.<strong> Bianca Lawson&nbsp;</strong>sounds so bad-ass when she speaks French. She should never stop speaking French.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>2. I’ll give anyone $100 if they can explain that druid/oak nonsense the&nbsp;veterinarian&nbsp;was yammering about.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>3. I know this week’s victim has a girlfriend, but am I crazy for thinking he was flirting with Scott in that opening scene? I think I’ve just been single for too long.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>4. I love that Isaac and Scott are roommies now. It’s sure to make the love triangle even more awkward. Plus, Stiles (<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Dylan O’Brien</strong></a>) will probably also get jealous.</p><h3>WATCH:<a href=# rel=nofollow>‘Teen Wolf’ Recap: What Did Lydia See in The Fire?</a></h3><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-14><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><img decoding=async alt="Subscribe to me on YouTube" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hl-yt-subscribe.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p id=content-paragraph-15><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what did you think of this week’s&nbsp;Teen Wolf?
