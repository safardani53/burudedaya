During a V LIVE broadcast with Ryujin, she discussed the behind-the-scenes anecdotes, revealing that her one-line dialogue was ultimately cut from the video because she “sounded rather weird.”</p><p>The 11-minute highlight reel served as the basis for the Bangtan Universe, with each member’s character journey shown. Yuna debuted in the narrative of Jung Kook’s character, the youngest member of the group. The two became apparent friends in the hospital, sharing their own loneliness.&nbsp;Yuna of ITZY yearned for a new appearance. She said that she wanted to be attractive like other females but was needed to “appear unwell” for her job as a patient.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>i always laugh remembering when yuna and ryujin talk about being in bts’ highlight reel and yuna being like they made me look ugly and took away my one line <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/NP6O1J4CbN</a></p><p>— lia’s party planner (@bIankspace) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">May 5, 2021</a></p><h2>ITZY’s Yuna discusses her filming experiences, regrets, and film cuts in BTS’ highlight reel.</h2><p>ITZY’s Yuna’s appearance with BTS’s Jung Kook in LOVE YOURSELF’s Highlight Reel is a tale that will likely never get old. The 2017 video soon became a topic of conversation and is now an integral component of the Bangtan Universe or BU. It features numerous now-idol females, notably Yuna, and provides crucial context for the plot.&nbsp;Yuna of ITZY stops BTS’s Jung Kook as he speeds up his wheelchair dangerously in one of the scenarios. The BTS member accepts her offer of friendship as she offers her hand to him.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ITZYs-Yuna-2.jpeg alt="ITZY's Yuna" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Yuna said in a 2020 V LIVE with Ryujin that she had a line for that moment, but it was cut because she sounded weird.&nbsp;The session started with Ryujin reminding Yuna that she had a dialogue. The youngest child of ITZY then gasped, repeated the words, and recalled as follows:</p><p>“‘Be cautious, it’s hazardous,'” That’s correct. However, the phrase sounded like “Wait!” since I was a trainee at the time. As it was my first time speaking in front of so many staff members in that situation, I sounded rather uneasy.”</p><p>She then described how the team requested that she merely make a gesture, and how the dialogue was ultimately eliminated.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ITZYs-Yuna-2.jpg alt="ITZY's Yuna" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“They instructed me to remove “It’s hazardous” from the phrase “Wait, it’s dangerous.” Then they said, “Yuna, simply raise your hand,” thus my line was eliminated. I believe I can do a better job today.”</p><p>Before addressing the dialogue, Yuna of ITZY said that she felt unhappy without cosmetics. While other women went about with makeup and lipstick, the Crazy in Love cast member’s part required her to seem ill.&nbsp;Meanwhile, another member of ITZY, Ryujin, also appeared in the clip. She portrayed J-hope and Jimin’s dancing buddy.&nbsp;Released on August 18, 2017, the LOVE YOURSELF Highlight Reel presently has 33,1 million views on YouTube. It is one of those videos that often surfaces in nostalgic discussions among ITZY and BTS fans.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGigrbKpqHq6wc2aZKygkaeytHnHnqlmq6Skv7p5wZ6foqaUYsGpsYysmp6mlah6sLKMrZ%2BeZZKpwG60yKCfpaGXncFuvsSeo2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
