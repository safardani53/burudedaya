It’s my therapy, my self-help,” says Shania.</p><p>“Even if this procedure on my larynx doesn’t hold up, I’ve still got songwriting.</p><p>“It’s all I would do if you didn’t stop me.</p><p>“I would probably forget to sleep.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>‘Giddy Up! is still very country, still the old Shania’</h2><p>As if to confirm her passion for all things equine, her album’s opening song is a riotous hoedown called Giddy Up!</p><p>“I’m just saying, ‘OK, party’s on’,” she affirms.</p><p>“It’s still very country, still the old Shania but it’s also me with a fresh outlook.”</p><p>That outlook is plain to hear in the title track which includes the line “I’m a queen who doesn’t need a king”, reaffirming her fabled independent spirit.</p><p>“I really feel like I’m driving my own bus,” she says, although she might as well have said, “Riding my own horse”.</p><p>The Queen Of Me cover picture likewise sets the tone for what lies within—Shania on a beautiful dark steed in a revealing black outfit and looking every inch a woman in control of her destiny.</p><p>“I was very specific about that photo,” she reveals. “It contains so many messages.</p><p>“I wanted it to represent somebody who is in charge of their own actions. Sitting up on a horse is just that in itself.&nbsp;</p><p>“And I’m not wearing a bra,” she adds triumphantly.</p><p>“I’m being very forthcoming about newfound confidence in my body image.”</p><p>Shania says she’s fed up with hearing that keeping in shape is “more difficult as you get older”.</p><p>“Well, it can only get worse so, if I don’t start loving my body now, I’m doomed!”</p><p>When she broke through in the Nineties, Shania was approaching 30 and something of a late bloomer.</p><p>She embarked on an unequalled run of three diamond albums in the States, The Woman In Me (1995), Come On Over (1997) and Up! (2002), each surpassing ten million sales.&nbsp;</p><p>Among her hook-laden hits were Any Man Of Mine, You’re Still The One, Man! I Feel Like A Woman and That Don’t Impress Me Much.</p><p>Her videos were key, revealing a sassy, sexy performer with a wicked sense of humour.</p><p>Today, she says: “I know I’m never going to look 30 again and I refuse to be disappointed about that.</p><p>“I want to look in the mirror and go, ‘Yeah, I’m 57 and this is what the average 57-year-old looks like naturally’.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>‘I loved company of horses but I couldn’t afford one’</h2><p>Though she is mostly based in Switzerland where she lives on a farm with <a href=#>second husband Frédéric Thiébaud</a>, ­Shania is speaking to me from America’s West Coast.</p><p>I ask her what sort of fitness regime she employs.</p><p>“I still ride fairly often,” she replies. “I had a really good, physical ride yesterday.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was thinking, ‘Oh boy, maybe I’ve pushed it a bit’, but I feel great today. Also I’m very active on stage and I do really watch what I eat.”&nbsp;</p><p>Shania first fell in love with horses when she was ten, living with her hard-up family in the mining town of Timmins, Ontario.</p><p>“We had neighbours with horses and I just wanted to be around them,” she says.</p><p>“I couldn’t ride them — I didn’t know how to — but I would clean the stalls and feed them.</p><p>“I really loved their company and then I slowly started riding without any ­training.”</p><p>Despite singing in clubs from a very early age, she recalls: “I couldn’t own a horse because I couldn’t afford one.</p><p>“Riding is not a poor person’s sport in North America.”&nbsp;</p><p>Her mother Sharon and stepfather Jerry could barely afford a car and when Shania was 22, still dreaming of hitting the big time, they were killed in a road accident, leaving her to look after her younger siblings.</p><p>“It wasn’t until I was 29 that I could buy my first horse and, ever since, I’ve been riding as much as I can,” she ­continues.</p><p>One of Shania’s most memorable ­videos was shot in <a href=#>Egypt </a>for The Woman In Me (Needs The Man In You) and shows her in a flowing white dress galloping around the pyramids.</p><p>She remembers it well and says: “If you want to do anything really epic, you have to be up for the adventure.</p><p>“That&nbsp;one was definitely an adventure! I couldn’t be precious about it because I was riding a horse I didn’t know in rusty stirrups with bare feet and no helmet.&nbsp;</p><p>“It was dangerous, very rocky and wild, but I’ve always felt brave about exploring the visual element of my music.</p><p>“It’s very important to me.”&nbsp;</p><p>Today, thanks to all her success, she can enjoy an idyllic life beside Lake Geneva.</p><p>“<a href=#>Switzerland</a> is my base and most of my horses are there. We also take our dogs out on a boat all the time,” she says.</p><p>“I love being on the lake. Growing up in Canada, there were lakes everywhere.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/2022-peoples-choice-awards-held-781159753.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/1fc3790c-9ebe-4b6b-9f9a-b94be6ad2d80.jpg><p>Last year, a captivating Netflix biopic, Not Just A Girl, charted Shania’s rise from poverty in rural Ontario to global superstardom.&nbsp;</p><p>It showed pictures and footage of this young girl with a clear, sweet voice singing in seedy bars to help scrape a living for her family.</p><p>She says: “Looking back at that stuff, I couldn’t help thinking, ‘Wow, this is probably why I had stage fright for so many years’.&nbsp;</p><p>“I was performing in bars full of drunk adults, places that were just not comfortable for me at that age. It was very intimidating.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>‘I’ve always been a hybrid artist’</h2><p>“But I loved the music. I loved to sing, I loved writing and I was very professional about it.</p><p>“As I say in the film, I really did have a hundred songs in my repertoire.”</p><p>Despite vivid memories of that time, Shania says: “I feel a little disassociated from it — as though it was another lifetime.</p><p>“But whoever I am now is due to all those experiences.</p><p>“Whether they were good or bad, they contributed to my talent, my character and my whole perspective on life and career.”</p><p>The Not Just A Girl documentary revisits the moment she finally got a record deal to make her self-titled debut in 1993, though success did not come overnight.</p><p>But when she hooked up with producer and husband-to-be Mutt Lange, they struck gold (or, I should say, diamonds).</p><p>He had worked with AC/DC, including their seminal Back In Black album, Def Leppard and Foreigner.</p><p>By bringing rock into the mix with country and pop, Shania had an all-conquering, stadium-sized sound.</p><p>“I have always been a hybrid artist,” she says.</p><p>“My earliest roots are my grandparents’ and parents’ country music, Willie Nelson, Loretta Lynn, Waylon Jennings.&nbsp;</p><p>“I still really like those story­tellers and my songwriting education came from them. But, as I got into my teens, the bars were hiring rock bands so my repertoire had to change.&nbsp;</p><p>“I started doing Journey and Queen and The Beatles and, by the time I got a deal, I had developed my own style.</p><p>“Then when Mutt heard my voice, he brought the rock edge in even more with guitar-led arrangements.”</p><p>Cue those three diamond albums, huge arena shows and those iconic videos which all made Shania the best-selling female country artist in history.</p><p>Next, however, came twin devastations—first she contracted Lyme disease, preventing her from singing, and then cheating Mutt ran off with her best friend, Marie-Anne Thiébaud.</p><p>After her 2010 divorce, in a remarkable twist, she married Marie-Anne’s ex-husband Frédéric.</p><p>But Shania believes the most “challenging” of her setbacks was losing her voice. “I had seven years of not knowing if I would sing again,” she says.</p><p>In the film, you see how Lionel Richie persuaded her to join him in the Bahamas to record a new duet of his ballad Endless Love, originally featuring Diana Ross.</p><p>It proved to be Shania’s first baby step back to the limelight.</p><p>“That was before I had the operation but at least I knew my voice was somewhere in there, that my muscle memory could kick in,” she says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/shania-twain-performs-stage-2022-781175538.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/janet-mayer-splashnews-com-splash-786689095.jpg><p>“Then all I had to do was get the anatomy sorted. There was no other choice but to have this operation.</p><p>“It was the only possible procedure out there and so I was like, ‘OK, well, if I really want to sing again for real, I’ve got to do this.’ So I took the plunge.”</p><p>In 2017, Shania released her comeback album Now and, er, now she’s taken things to the next level with Queen Of Me.</p><p>She says: “This album is an experiment in testing my voice, where will it go, where won’t it go.</p><p>“I have mourned never being able to do certain things again but I learned very quickly to focus on what I can do.</p><p>“There are still a lot of lovely qualities in there. I like them, I enjoy them and I don’t try to fix them. They are part of the character of my new voice.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>I sense from talking to this unstoppable soul that she won’t be riding off into the sunset any time soon.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>SHANIA TWAIN</h2><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Queen&nbsp;Of Me</h2><h2 class=has-text-align-center><span>★★★★☆</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/shania-twain-sftw-music-pr-790831570.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvYmiEdISQaKqhmZ6erm7A1pqgp2WemsRurcubrKZloaqyprqMqJ1mpZVk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
