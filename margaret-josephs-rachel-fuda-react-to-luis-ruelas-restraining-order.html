It’s pathetic.”</p><p>Ruelas did not immediately respond to Us’ request for comment, while Dietl — who previously denied being hired by the Bravo personality to look into Giudice’s RHONJ costars — told <a href=#>Page Six</a> earlier this week that any potential hiring of a private investigator is confidential.</p><p>“As far as whether [Ruelas] hired us for potential private investigations, that’s confidentially [sic],” Dietl stated.</p><p>Anton told Us on Wednesday that Ruelas should “fall on his own sword, save his friend’s reputation as a private investigator, protect this young female employee from having her credibility destroyed and admit he did this, give a legal, non-harassing reason why and have his lawyer communicate that to my office.”</p><p>He continued: “I will then discuss it with my client and if it is reasonable, and she feels comfortable enough with the reason to allay her fears from this harassment and intimidation, even if she does not like that he did it, I will recommend that she dismiss the TRO and this matter can conclude peacefully for all parties.”</p><p>Prior to news of Reiser’s restraining order, Ruelas was named in a <a href=#>harassment lawsuit against his company</a>, Digital Media Solutions. According to court documents obtained by Us last month, a woman named <strong>Juanita Williams</strong> is suing the business for receiving multiple telemarketing calls despite being on their “Do Not Call” registry.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Williams also claimed that she upon answering one of the calls in September 2022, she was directed to an insurance agent who allegedly told her the company had generated her number as a potential sales lead. She is seeking $1,500 per phone call. Ruelas and Giudice did not respond to the lawsuit or Us’ request for comment at the time.</p><p>With reporting by Fortune Benatar</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaKcrrOx02ahqKuVpbW0edGamqGdnGKztrDAZqmemZOperW7jKWsoqtdp8KmuMCsZKudo6m%2ForXNoqWgZZ%2Bnsaa%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
