You had a great sense of humor and a lively spirit. Growing up, I was your baby, and you were my best friend,” Angel, 36, wrote via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> on Sunday, December 24, sharing throwback family photos. “Life wasn’t fair to you, that I know. Sometimes, it feels like you didn’t have a shot, no matter what.”</p><p class=p3>She continued: “Experiencing innocence instead of being burdened by trauma, pain and suffering is incredibly important for children, particularly at such a young age. I know why Leslie [Carter], Aaron [Carter] and now you <a href=#>ended up in the circumstances</a> that you did. I share that pain we experienced during our childhood and I’m sorry you didn’t have an opportunity for a better life. … I love you BJ, you’re free now. <span class=s1>💔🕊️</span>.”</p><p class=p3>Robert Carter and <strong>Jane Carter</strong>, who divorced in 2004, shared five children: <strong>Nick Carter</strong>, Bobbie Jean, Leslie and twins Aaron and Angel. Daughter Leslie <a href=#>died in 2012 after a drug overdose</a> nearly 10 years before their son Aaron’s death. The late rapper <a href=#>died at the age of 34 in 2022</a> after accidentally drowning due to the effects of difluoroethane and alprazolam. (Robert, for his part, <a href=#>died in 2017</a> at the age of 65.)</p><p class=p3>Jane confirmed on Saturday that <a href=#>Bobbie Jean had passed away</a>.</p><p class=p3>“I am in shock from learning of the sudden death of my daughter, Bobbie Jean; and I will need time to process the terrible reality of this happening for the third time,” Jane told TMZ in a statement. “When I am able to think clearly, I’ll release a fuller statement; but until then I would request to be left to grieve in private.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Angel-Carter-Mourns-Older-Sister-Bobbie-Jean-After-Death-3.jpg><p class=p3>She continued: “[H]owever deeply a parent feels the loss of a child, the suffering of a young child at the loss of a parent must be much greater. So, I would ask the sympathetic to say a prayer for my precious 8-year-old granddaughter Bella, who previously lost her father and is now also left without her mother.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p3>While Bobbie Jean’s cause of death has not been publicly shared, a source exclusively told <i>Us Weekly </i>that her loved ones believe that she suffered cardiac arrest.</p><p class=p3>Bobbie Jean is survived by daughter Bella, mother Jane, and siblings Angel and Nick, 43. “Nick is having a really hard time processing the whole situation,” the insider added to <i>Us.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaappeauW6vwKurnqpdory2vs2sZKiklJq%2Fbr%2FIrKueql2XvKOuyJ5ko52Ro3qistOeqWaclZbBqXnArWSan5VigXJ7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
