But it was too late.</p><p>Dad told me: “The only bad news is that my brother Peter could be banned from the home ground now for dancing on tables and celebrating.</p><p>“He’s been my No1 from day one — and it’s got him in plenty of trouble.</p><p>“He and a few others are part of a gang that has turned up every week, faced the defeats, and is already planning to go to Shrewsbury away in the league.”</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>West Ham announce Marko Arnautovic contract extension straight after shock Wimbledon loss</span><p>Wimbledon were 9-1 with the bookies to beat <a href=#>West Ham</a>. My mates and family were saying they were going to back them.</p><p>But they’ve been struggling to score, so I gave them my opinion: “If you’re going to back them at all, back them to win 1-0 and get 14-1 or 18-1, don’t waste your money.”</p><p>Some listened and I cost them a few quid — but they didn’t care after the game.</p><p>Dad said: “I could not be more proud of that squad.</p><p>“Doubters might say, ‘West Ham put a lesser side out’, but we made five changes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/afc7-e1548630035245.png><p>“I have total faith in this squad and hopefully those changes justified that.</p><p>“What a wonderful challenge I have for the next game!”</p><p>We spent the night celebrating in the club bar then dad, his girlfriend Clare, Pete and myself bundled back to see Marie, my dad’s mum, in Shepherd’s Bush.</p><p>We all slept there and when I woke up on her sofa it was in a drunken daze — but I could still see my dad on a chair across the room.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000464568473-e1548629283656.jpg><p>Pete was on the floor in the corner and I was saying, ‘Did he do it? Honestly, did he pull it off?’”</p><p>We all just couldn’t stop giggling.</p><p>We were still so drunk that none of us could be sure he had actually done it.</p><p>The five of us lay on the bed watching Match of the Day and couldn’t stop laughing.</p><p>It was so funny seeing what happened and how they did it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000464563144-e1548629411579.jpg><p>The boss (dad) said: “We watched Match of the Day together and didn’t stop laughing. My mum is 70-odd and my harshest critic — but even she managed a bit of a smile.</p><p>“One of the West Ham coaches had his head in his hands every five minutes, when we scored. I’ve been there, so I know how he felt.</p><p>“We just couldn’t stop laughing. We weren’t analysing it, we were just laughing like silly.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT0004645420851-e1548629681296.jpg><p>A hair of the dog was required, so we headed to Acton Vale working men’s club in Shepherd’s Bush.</p><p>We were there by 9.15am for a champagne breakfast then a few Bloody Marys.</p><p>We just kept looking at each other and giggling.</p><p>Dad popped in for two quick halves, then he went out to meet agents to try to get player deals done.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/afc3-e1548629090603.jpg><p>After last night, Acton Vale have made him next on the list to become a lifetime member — he is 57 and normally you have to be 80 for that!</p><p>When I got home last night, it was tough explaining to my two-year-old boy how much his grandad had achieved.</p><p>Dad did really well coaching at West Ham and <a href=#>QPR</a> and left unceremoniously, swiftly, out of the back door.</p><p>So we never really got the chance to celebrate what he’d achieved working with those clubs.</p><p>To achieve what he did on Saturday was really amazing, I was so emotional for him.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in football</h2></p><p>I never even saw him play for Wimbledon. I grew up with all these incredible stories of the ‘Crazy Gang’ and it means a lot to me but I never saw any of it.</p><p>My boy is far too young to understand my dad is managing Wimbledon, so every positive result is a step towards him doing that.</p><p>My hope is that my boy will say to me one day, ‘F****** hell, I remember when grandad was a manager’. I don’t have any memories like those.</p><p>The <a href=#>FA Cup</a> is great of course — but the club needs to stay in League One and dad needs to keep his job. It would be wonderful if my boy could grow up and see dad do well for a club.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLOwu9ObmKWkX21%2Fen6Ucm5or5Ghubp5w6iup52jYq6nr4ywoKaanJqxsLqMsJysrF2drq55xZpknK2gZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
