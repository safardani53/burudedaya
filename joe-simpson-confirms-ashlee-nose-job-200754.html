"Anyway, there was a real problem with her breathing and that was cured."</p><p>Joe, who also serves as manager to Ashlee, 22, and her sister Jessica, 27, credits good parenting as the reason his daughters haven't gone the way of Lindsay Lohan or Britney Spears.</p><p>"We have a real family," he said. "You can't just put these kids out in the world and they're on their own. I can remember a time when Jessica was singing at Madison Square Garden and her outfit ripped before she went on. We were there for her."</p><p>And then there was Ashlee's Saturday Night Live debacle.</p><p>"She'd lost her voice, and Jordan Schur [then the head of her record label] insisted she lip-synch," he said. "She'd never done it before.&nbsp;She didn't want to do it. Anyway, she'll never do it again. We just did a huge tour, and there was no lip-synching."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The former Baptist minister also denies claims that he's a controlling father. "I don't tell my girls who to date or marry or what to do."</p><p>He also has no hard feelings against former son-in-law <strong>Nick Lachey</strong>. "I have nothing against Nick," he told me. "But they got married very young. I told Jessica, 'You're going to hit an age when it's all going to be clear to you — life, that is — and you'll know what you want to do.'"&nbsp;Joe added: "I do blame 50 percent of their break-up on the media."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp5ViwKq5z6ymp2WTpLuntdGmqmaZo525prGMp6asnV2fvKN5kWlncG1kZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
