To make that a reality, the 37-year-old has partnered with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stryx</a> cosmetics and skincare, a brand designed to help men look and feel their best.</p><p>The Bravo star’s relationship with makeup goes back to when he started modeling, about 22 years ago, at the age of 15 or 16. The Missouri native noticed that makeup artists didn’t touch up his imperfections in the same way that they did for female models and thus, he didn’t look his best in photos.</p><p>“They would spend hours on the girls and like give me lip balm,” the star told Us Weekly exclusively on Tuesday, August 4. “And I would like get pictures back where I’m like my skin looks like shit, I’m like shiny, you know what I mean? I can’t even use these pictures.”</p><p>To fix the problem and ultimately help his modeling career, he got to work. “I went with a makeup artist, got my own makeup and started kind of easing into that and then once I just started thinking about how like pretty much 99.9% of every guy you see on TV or in a magazine, they’re definitely wearing makeup.” Enter, Sandoval’s epiphany. He thought, “Why can’t I take advantage of that?”</p><p>Devir Kahan, the founder of Stryx, had a similar experience that inspired him to launch the company in 2017. “He had a blemish on his wedding day and it was in all the photos and he was inspired to do something about it,” said Sandoval. “And this happens all the time. I mean, it’s like a classic example, like bride and groom at a wedding, the girl looks flawless, she’s had two hours of makeup, and the guy has got razor bumps and is shiny.”</p><p>To spread the word about Stryx, the California resident’s been introducing both friends and strangers alike to the products. When he was at Coachella, he helped out a friend by touching up his dark circles using the brand’s concealer. “I was like, ‘Hey, I want to show you something.’ And I put it on and he was like, ‘Whoa!’ I was like, ‘Yeah man.’ And then I saw him like at a party or out somewhere like later on and he’s like ‘Yo hey um can I get that Stryx stuff?”</p><p>So if you’re a man who’s thinking about trying cosmetics but are a little hesitant, heed Sandoval’s advice. “Try it out at home, he suggests. “Try some concealer on spots, start with a little bit, you can always add more.” There’s no better time to try than right now anyway, since everyone’s encouraged to stay home as much as possible due to the COVID-19 outbreak.</p><p>To Sandoval, the brand is less about making people look good and more about making them feel their best. “I want people to feel okay, I want people to ask questions, to feel comfortable in their own skin, to feel comfortable bettering themselves,” he explained. “It’s such a thing that guys struggle with and they shouldn’t have to. And the only way to do that is to try to lead by example.”</p><p>The brand is actively looking to launch more products, but right now, it’s core line is made up of three formulas: concealer, tinted moisturizer and gel cleanser.
