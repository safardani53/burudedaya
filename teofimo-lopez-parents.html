Originally from Spain, his family migrated to Honduras after the Second World War.</p><p>Although many of his family members still live in Honduras, his grandmother, like many Hondurans, emigrated to the United States with her children when his dad Teófimo Sr. was five.</p><p>They had moved to the States for better lives. But Teófimo Sr.’s childhood was tough.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Little-Teofimo-Lopez-With-His-Dad-Teofimo-Jr-e1686481396698.jpg><p>Not only had they had difficulty paying school fees, their mother had to do many jobs to provide them with food and other basic needs. But that was insufficient.</p><p>As a result, Teofimo Sr. did not even finish high school.</p><p>To make it worse, young Teófimo Sr. became addicted to drugs at a young age, and he continued doing it even after his marriage to Teofimo Lopez’s mom.</p><p>Luckily, she had a bartending job at a strip club, which somehow assisted them financially.</p><p>His mother, Jenny López, had a no different life from his dad while growing up. She was raised in a poor household in New York and did not go to college either.</p><p>Teofimo Lopez’s birth gave his family a way out. Since his dad was a <a href=#>boxing</a> enthusiast, he began teaching boxing to his young son when he was six.</p><p>Since Teofimo is a successful boxer, Jenny and Teófimo Sr.’s life has completely changed.</p><p>Teófimo Sr. is still active as his son’s boxing coach. They have not revealed if they have any other children aside from Teofimo Lopez.</p><h2>Will Teofimo Lopez Retire Anytime Soon?</h2><p>With continued success since his professional debut, it is ridiculous to discuss Teofimo Lopez’s retirement now. In his mid-twenties, Teofimo has lost only one fight and still has many battles to conquer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Josh-Taylor-Recently-Lost-His-Titles-To-Teofimo-Lopez-e1686481643640.jpg><p>He recently won a fight against the Scottish Josh Taylor at Hulu Theatre on June 10 in New York City.</p><p>Taylor had previously announced he would defend his WBO and The Ring light welterweight belts against Lopez in April 2023.</p><p>Following the match, Teofimo expressed joy, saying, “It’s been a long time coming. We just beat the No. 1 ranked guy, the No. 1 champion, former undisputed champion.“</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunDAxKidoqWfYrmwvMSzZKmZopq7tb%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
