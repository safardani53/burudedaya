(Hicks and Porter are reportedly no longer together.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here’s what you need to know about the elusive Hicks, who rarely speaks publicly and has no social media presence.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>1.
