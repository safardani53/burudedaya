And here's why.&nbsp;</p><h2>Celebrities Who Won't Be on&nbsp;Deux Moi</h2><p>Deux Moi made a rare appearance on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Andy Cohen's</a>&nbsp;show,&nbsp;Radio Andy, in October&nbsp;2021.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>During the interview, the anonymous gossip creator got <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">candid about the celebrities</a> she voluntarily didn't post about on her Instagram. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>At first, Cohen shed light on stars whose fans, as per him, were dogmatic. He mentioned <a href=# rel=follow>Taylor Swift</a>, BTS, and <a href=# rel=follow>Nicki Minaj</a>. Then he asked Deux Moi if there were cases where posting about these worldwide famous celebs made her feel inundated. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Without hesitation, Deux Moi shared she sometimes didn't post about famous people because she didn't want to deal with the trouble that might come with the gossip.&nbsp;</p><p>She then set&nbsp;the record straight, clarifying that Minaj's fans were nicer than people expected and "Taylor Swift fans are just&nbsp;passionate about her." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Next, Deux Moi revealed people had warned her early on not to post anything about BTS. She feared the army would ruin her life if she uploaded anything they didn't like.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"So I stay away from BTS and Scientology," Deux Moi reiterated, explaining she didn't post about the two subjects.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Deux Moi Has an Entire File on Andy Cohen</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Besides talking about people she would never post about, Deux Moi shared insights into the rumors she had heard about the interview host.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As per her accounts, she had an entire <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">file of information on Cohen</a>. She started getting submissions about him right from the time her&nbsp;Instagram account gained traction in March 2020.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>I had a lot of information, and I was able to give sort of my real opinion based upon the information from the Andy Cohen file.</p><p>When asked if the rumors were good ones or bad,&nbsp;Deux Moi replied diplomatically. She shared that the information would have upset many people, but his fans would have never shipped it.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She even disclosed that many of his well-wishers fought for him through the DMs. The discussion was on the verge&nbsp;of igniting a controversy, so Deux Moi&nbsp;had to stop posting about him.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJyVqsVuuc6iZJydnJqvs7XTopysZpipuq0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
