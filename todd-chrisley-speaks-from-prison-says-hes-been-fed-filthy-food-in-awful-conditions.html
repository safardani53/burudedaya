These men are getting, I don’t know, they are getting a thousand calories a day.”</p><p>Poor conditions in prisons across the nation is definitely a topic of debate and interest these days.</p><p>Yes, it’s difficult to feel any sympathy for Todd Chrisley, who almost always comes across as an out-of-touch, pompous, entitled A-Hole.</p><p>But many people would agree that the point of imprisoning individuals is not to rob them of their basic humanity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/todd-chrisley-up-close-1024x962.jpg><p>Chrisley told NewsNation that he only eats food that he buys and prepares himself from the commissary.</p><p>But that a prison warden has taken to restricting how much he can purchase as punishment… for just being famous, we guess.</p><p>“One of the warden’s ways of — I’ve been told this by a staff member — one of the ways she was trying to break me is by cutting down what you can buy in commissary,” Chrisley alleges, saying that he originally could buy 12 packs of tuna a week, which has since been cut to three.</p><p>Chrisley said that he has heard recordings of staff members saying that “he needs to be humbled.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/12/Todd-Chrisley-2-1.jpg><p>This summer, Chrisley’s lawyer said something similar, telling anyone who would listen that <a href=#>Chrisley is being harassed</a> due to his public profile and alleged attitude.</p><p>The Chrisley Knows Best patriarch also said that he is restricted in his communications with fellow jailed wife Julie Chrisley, who is serving her own sentence at the Federal Medical Center in Lexington, Kentucky.</p><p>“It’s devastating. She and I email four or five times a day. But they will hold my emails and hold them on her end as well, as a way of punishment,” Todd said.</p><p>“She may not get mine for five days later.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/10/1011_toddchrisley_01-742x1024.jpg><p>Todd and Julie Chrisley were sentenced to 12 years and seven years of prison, respectively, for tax evasion and bank fraud.</p><p>The former’s sentence was since lowered to 10 years and Julie’s has been reduced to six, while both are being appealed in general by their legal teams.</p><p>“I know that God has a greater purpose,” Todd said to wrap up this interview.</p><p>“I know He has a greater plan. And I’m not going to let the federal government break my faith.”</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2Z%2FcMDOnZtmm5intrS4xLJkrKiVlri0ecWrpqZloKe2tLvNZqqasaNitaa%2FjJucnqZdm7KlecWio62gqWKzsLvDZqCnZZGss7a4jJymp5yZqbawutJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
