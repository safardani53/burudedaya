However, she was further thrown into the spotlight when she dated <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Pete Davidson</a>. The pair <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>dated for nearly a year</a> before calling it quits.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actress costarred opposite the Saturday Night Live alum in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Bodies Bodies Bodies</a>, a slasher film that premiered in March 2022. Wonders and Davidson played a couple in the movie.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The pair <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>first sparked romance rumors</a> in December 2022 when they attended a New York Rangers game together, alongside castmate Rachel Sennott. Wonders and Davidson seemingly confirmed their relationship a month later when they were <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>spotted together in Hawaii</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Pete and Chase Sui have been hanging out and having fun," an insider told PEOPLE at the time, adding: "It doesn't seem like a long-term thing though."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In March 2023, the couple were <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>reportedly involved in a car accident</a>, in which the vehicle Davidson was driving ran into a fire hydrant in Beverly Hills, California. Wonders was a passenger in the car. According to reports, no one was injured in the collision.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prior to dating Wonders, Davidson was linked to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Emily Ratajkowski</a>. A source close to the model confirmed to PEOPLE in December 2022 that the pair <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>split after two months of dating</a>. And prior to Ratajkowski, Davidson split from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Kim Kardashian</a> in August 2022 after <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>nine months of dating</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The King of Staten Island star was once also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>romantically linked</a> to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Bridgerton</a>'s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Phoebe Dynevor</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Kaia Gerber</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>Kate Beckinsale</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=6>Margaret Qualley</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=7>Ariana Grande</a>, whom he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=8>proposed</a> to in 2018.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's everything to know about Wonders, from how she got her start in acting to her famed fashion family member.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-she-and-davidson-costarred-in-bodies-bodies-bodies-and-bupkis></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>She and Davidson costarred in Bodies Bodies Bodies and Bupkis</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Rich Fury/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Davidson and Wonders starred in Bodies Bodies Bodies, which also featured <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Borat 2</a> star <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Maria Bakalova</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Amandla Stenberg</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Lee Pace</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel="noopener nofollow">Rachel Sennott</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=6 rel=noopener>Myha'la Herrold</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"When a group of rich 20-somethings plan a hurricane party at a remote family mansion, a party game turns deadly in this fresh and funny look at backstabbing, fake friends, and one party gone very, very wrong," reads <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>an official synopsis</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Wonders played Davison's on-screen girlfriend in the film that she described to PopSugar as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>"very obviously satire"</a> in regards to its "big picture."
