Many celebs are joined by their children, who either introduce them to the app or include them in their content.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>There's also a thriving community of celebrity doppelgangers on the app, especially with those using DeepFake technology.</p><p>Recently, <a href=#>Paul Rudd</a>'s son, <a href=#>Jack Sullivan Rudd</a>, has gone viral on the app for his resemblance to his father.

Most recently, Paul and his family attended the 2023 Super Bowl, where they celebrated the Kansas City Chiefs' victory over the Philadelphia Eagles.</p><p>Father and son were interviewed post-game by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox Sports</a>, which immediately piqued the interest of social media users everywhere. Fans began to notice that Paul and Jack's voices sounded nearly identical, spurring hundreds of TikToks, Tweets, and Instagram posts about the interview. One user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>, "He talks just like his dad," while another <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>, "Paul Rudd's son is more Paul Rudd than Paul Rudd!"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>As he is still a teen, it's unclear if Jack would ever follow his father's footsteps into the acting world. Jack, like his father, currently has no social media pages, much less a TikTok. There is one social media user claiming to be Paul Rudd's son on TikTok who has garnered millions of likes due to their resemblance.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is @jaycubrudd on TikTok Paul Rudd's son?</h2><p>TikTok user @jaycubrudd popped up on For You pages in early 2020, claiming to be Paul Rudd's son for their resemblance. The creator, whose account currently has more than 250,000 followers, has capitalized on how similar he looks to Paul Rudd, even re-creating some of Paul's most famous film scenes and dressing up as Paul's characters for Halloween.</p><p>"Hold up this isn't Paul Rudd???" one user commented on one of his TikToks, while another said, "PAUL RUDD'S SON ARE YOU KIDDING?"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In response to some of the comments asking him point-blank if he's actually Paul's son, Jacob made a TikTok addressing the question.</p><p>"Wait is Paul Rudd really you're dad?!?" the text on the video reads, to which Jacob nods his head before giving the camera a dramatic wink.</p><p>While it's no secret that the creator looks similar to the middle-aged heartthrob, Jacob is not actually Paul's son. In fact, his name isn't actually Jacob Rudd.</p><p>In a previous link to "Jacob"s Instagram, audiences are redirected to a profile for a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jacob Woodall</a>. Jacob is a comedian from Hawaii and is not related to Paul in any way.</p><p>So, just to be clear: Paul Rudd's only biological son is Jack Sullivan Rudd, who, as far as we know, has never created his own TikToks (but could that change in the future following his sudden rise to viral fame? Maybe so). Jacob Rudd is actually comedian Jacob Woodall who performs a great impression of Paul!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpa62uIyrrJ2cXai8r3nToqKtp5s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
