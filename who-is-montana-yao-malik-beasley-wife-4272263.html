Montana and Malik are facing drug possession charges stemming from a Sept. 2020 incident at their Plymouth, MN home.&nbsp;</strong>Malik was charged by the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hennepin County Attorney’s office</a> with “felony threats of violence and fifth-degree drug possession,” while Montana faces the same fifth-degree drug possession charge. It stemmed from a Sept. 26 incident at their suburban Minneapolis home where he allegedly pointed a gun at trespassers. During a search warrant of the home for the rifle, officers found “835 grams of marijuana in the basement living room and main floor office,” according to the HCA’s press release. “When police interviewed Yao, she admitted that all the marijuana was hers, and that she purchased it from a medical marijuana store, though could not provide its location. Yao also did not have documentation indicating that she could have medical marijuana,” the Hennepin County Attorney’s office wrote in their release.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K6sLrTmqWaZamWvG65wKWgpGWSmq60uMSyZLChlpp6dX6Wa2lva18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
