However, the couple had been together since the late 90s. Their&nbsp;long relationship was alluded&nbsp;to when the late artist wrote an article on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Queerty</a>&nbsp;to share his&nbsp;suffering from HPV–Related Oral Cancer,&nbsp;which ultimately led him to the face of death in July 2016. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He wrote the piece from the hospital bed so that no one would have to go through the pain he went through and also prevent others from receiving a late diagnosis to save their lives.&nbsp;In addition to that, he also wrote how difficult it was to see the tears in his partner's eyes as he watched him battle for life.</p><h2>Doctors Failed to Dia<span>gnose Skiff's&nbsp;Oral Cancer</span></h2><p><span>Skiff's&nbsp;life-threatening stage IV cancer&nbsp;was misdiagnosed by not one but four different doctors. As per the aforementioned mentioned Querty </span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>article</span></a><span>, the doctors were unable to identify the HPV related oral cancer due to lack of FDA approved screening tools, limited research, and utmost ignorance by&nbsp;the physicians.&nbsp;And if that wasn't enough,&nbsp;Skiff being an HIV-positive patient&nbsp;worsened the situation.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span>Initially, in the 2013 winter, he </span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>felt discomfort</span></a><span>&nbsp;in his throat for almost 3 weeks. The pain started mildly&nbsp;but went on to become more severe. When he went for a check-up to his HIV specialist, the doctor<strong> </strong>refuted his claims of having throat cancer. He then&nbsp;went to his&nbsp;dentist for an oral checkup, but the dentist saw no concerning&nbsp;signs of cancer onset, and&nbsp;instead, called it a Temporomandibular Joint Disorder.</span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span>Following that, two more ENT professionals failed to diagnose his disease and gave him some antibiotic prescriptions. Things kept getting worse for Skiff, and in October 2013, he finally&nbsp;got a CT scan and biopsy done where the doctors found out about his advanced stage IV&nbsp;cancer that had already spread to his lymph nodes on the right side of his neck.&nbsp;</span></p><p>I was filled with rage. Not that I had cancer, that was no surprise. But how could it be that I understood that I was a high-risk person for HPV-related oral cancer when my doctors simply didn’t?</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The treatment with the combination of Chemotherapy and Radiation began as soon as he was diagnosed with cancer.</p><h2><span>McEwing Cleared the Air on His Disappearance</span></h2><p>In response to why the Fox 11 News Anchor hadn't appeared in a few episodes of th<span>e Morning Newscast b</span>ack in February 2020, the newscaster&nbsp;shared a post on his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook page</a> and revealed&nbsp;that he was diagnosed with Bell’s Palsy. He added that his case was relatively mild and clarified that he wouldn't return to work until he got better. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">disease</a> causes&nbsp;sudden and temporary weakness in facial muscles, which leads to face droops and one-sided smile. The actual cause is unknown; however, it is believed that it happens&nbsp;because of swelling or inflammation of a facial nerve that controls its movement.</span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p><span>Nearly after a month of his February Facebook&nbsp;post, the host went back to his work desk and shared his </span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>recovery</span></a><span> from Bell's Palsy on his Instagram. He is now healthy and is continuing to work on Fox 11 as the designated news anchor.</span></p><p>My recovery from Bell's palsy will continue for another couple of months or so but I now have almost complete function of my face again and total restoration of my speech.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6m8r8WMppqer5mjtG6zwLJkppmip7amsI2hq6ak</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
