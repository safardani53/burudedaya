After two years of waiting, the two NFL players began the podcast in 2022.</strong></p><p>The two brothers’ infectious personalities have certainly propelled their podcast to new heights. Their wholesome family videos are also well-loved by the fans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/new-heights-podcast.jpg><p>In 2023, the podcast found more fans in Swifties (Taylor Swift fans), with Travis dating the singer. The combination of football fans and Taylor Swift fans made the podcast number one in the US, dethroning <a href=# rel=noopener>Joe Rogan</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In their latest podcast, the two brothers are seen talking about the Super Bowl and the Chiefs’ win. Being the big brother, Jason also said it wasn’t cool from Travis’ side to shout and shove the head coach, <a href=# rel=noopener>Andy Reid</a>, the way he did on the sideline during the game.&nbsp;</p><h2>New Heights Podcast Net Worth 2024</h2><p>The Kelce brothers’ New Heights podcast is estimated to have a net worth of $2 million. The two footballers started their podcasting journey in 2022, and in the same year, the Kelce brothers reached the Super Bowl finals with their respective teams.</p><p>In 2023, the podcast soared with Travis dating the pop superstar Taylor Swift. Since the rumors of the footballer and singer began in July, the podcast has attained more listeners and viewers on Spotify and YouTube.&nbsp;</p><p>At one point, the brothers’ podcast became the number one on Spotify, ousting Joe Rogan. But even before Travis began dating Taylor, the New Heights podcast had become extremely popular among sports fans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/new-heights-revenue.jpg><p>The equation of Travis dating Taylor introduced people from other interests and backgrounds into the podcast. In September 2023, Joe Pompliano reported that the New Heights podcast charges up to 100% higher CPMs than the industry standard.</p><p>The podcast works with brands like DraftKings, LinkedIn, and Athletic Greens. On <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a>, the podcast’s page has 2.4 million followers, followed by a similar number on YouTube.</p><p>Social Blade shows that the podcast earns an estimated monthly earnings as high as $329.9k. Its subscribers have increased by 245.5%, and the best thing for the Kelce brothers is that they have managed to retain their viewers.&nbsp;</p><p>On TikTok, the short clips from the podcast are always going viral. Last year, several Swifties sent the two brothers messages asking them to explain the football terms on their show.&nbsp;</p><p>So, if in the future, for some reason, it doesn’t work out between Taylor and Travis, there is a high chance many Swifties will continue listening to the two athletes.&nbsp;</p><h2>How Did New Heights Begin?</h2><p>It was in 2020 that Travis Kelce’s longtime manager, Aaron Eanes, came up with the idea of New Heights. Hours after the playoff game, the Kelce brothers sat at a steakhouse and started discussing the game.</p><p>Seeing the two brothers’ connection, Eanes thought he could project it to millions of viewers and listeners. After the meal, the three of them became serious about the topic, and two years later, they came up with New Heights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/kelce-brothers-podcast.jpg><p>The trio held conversations with several companies, and finally, they landed on Wave Sports + Entertainment. Travis and Jason record remotely on Tuesday, usually a day off for NFL players, and a team of WSE employees edits, post-produces, and releases the show on Wednesday.&nbsp;</p><p>Previously, in an interview, Travis said, “It’s been good to just have that set amount of time to be able to just sit down and chat.</p><p>It’s like we’re just kicking it at dinner back when we were in high school and college together.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC6xLBkoZ2ZnLW1v4yppp2bkajBbrrErWSwp6KptW5%2Bj2trZq6RocKmec6fZKSdnJiybq7RqKuhnaJivbCwwpqqrWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
