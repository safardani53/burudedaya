itemprop=articleBody><p>ENGLAND international rugby union captain Owen Farrell's father is also a big name in the sport.</p><p>The Farrells seemingly have rugby flowing through their veins — here we take a look at <a href=#>Owen</a>'s father Andy, his life and career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2642df99-8b4a-4cc2-883c-022d34e92a0e.jpg><h2>Who is Owen Farrell's father, rugby star Andy Farrell?</h2><p>As well as being the proud dad of <a href=#>England</a> captain Owen, <a href=#>Andy David Farrell OBE</a>, born on May 30, 1975, is a former professional <a href=#>rugby league</a> and <a href=#>union</a> player.</p><p>He became the head coach of the <a href=#>Ireland national rugby union team</a>, in 2019.</p><p>As a Wigan legend Andy won the RFL and <a href=#>Super League</a> a staggering seven times, as well as the&nbsp;<a href=#>Challenge Cup</a>&nbsp;on six occasions.</p><p>He played for <a href=#>Wigan Warriors</a> over 300 times during a 13-year career, captained Great Britain and represented England in two <a href=#>World Cups</a>.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE ON RUGBY">READ MORE ON RUGBY</h2><p>For England he was a <a href=#>Rugby League World Cup</a> runner-up, losing to <a href=#>Australia</a> in a heartbreaking final.</p><p>In 2004, he won the Golden Boot awarded to the best players in the world, retiring on a high in 2005.</p><p>But, much to everyone's surprise, he decided to sign for <a href=#>Saracens </a>to play union.</p><p>Injuries and a car crash delayed the debut until 2006, when he found his position at centre for the Sarries.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Rugby Union</h2></p><p>In 2007, Andy made his England rugby union debut against <a href=#>Scotland</a> in <a href=#>the Six Nations</a>.</p><p>He was part of the England squad at the 2007 Rugby World Cup but only made eight international appearances in total.</p><p>A disappointing World Cup campaign saw him having to pull out of the quarter-final decider against Australia with a calf injury.</p><p>In 2009, he announced his retirement and took up a coaching role with Saracens at the end of the season.</p><p>After three seasons there, he gained further experience over another three-year spell as England's defence coach, before assuming the same role with <a href=#>Ireland</a>.</p><p>In 2019 he was made head coach of the Irish national union side.</p><h2>How old was Andy Farrell when Owen was born?</h2><p>Andy and his wife <a href=#>Colleen </a>were only 16 years old when their son Owen was born.</p><p>The couple has another son, their youngest child, named Gabriel.</p><p>They also&nbsp;<a href=#>have two other children</a>&nbsp;in daughters Elleshia and Gracie, who are both closer in age to Owen than Gabriel.</p><h2>Is Andy Farrell still married?</h2><p><a href=#>Wigan</a> native Andy wed Colleen, the sister of his former Wigan teammate Sean O'Loughlin, in 1995.</p><p>The childhood sweethearts got married after the birth of their first son Owen in 1991.</p><p>As a result, the surname on Owen's birth certificate originally was his mother's family name, O'Loughlin, but was changed to Farrell after the couple tied the knot.</p><p>The couple are still together to this day — heading into their third decade of marriage.</p><h2>Does Andy Farrell coach Ireland?</h2><p>After a year as Saracens first team coach, Farrell joined England's coaching team in 2012.</p><p>In 2013, he toured with the <a href=#>British and Irish Lions </a>as defence coach in <a href=#>Australia</a>, earning special praise from <a href=#>Warren Gatland</a>.</p><p>Farrell was then sacked by new England coach <a href=#>Eddie Jones</a> in 2015 after the Australian took over following a group stage World Cup exit.</p><p>Interestingly, son Owen then progressed to become England captain under Jones&nbsp;after <a href=#>Dylan Hartley was dropped</a>.</p><p>Partly as a result of his successful British and Irish Lions campaign, Andy was picked up by former Ireland head coach <a href=#>Joe Schmidt</a> and named defence coach in 2016.</p><p>He then helped the Irish to a Six Nations Grand Slam in 2018.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Following the 2019 Rugby World Cup, Schmidt stepped down as Ireland head coach, with <a href=#>Andy Farrell named his successor.</a></p><p>Since being appointed in 2019, he has led them to the top of the world rankings.</p><p class=postsid
