Kardashian revealed in new court docs obtained by TMZ and Page Six:</p><p>“I really want to divorce.” I requested Kanye to keep our divorce discreet, but he has refused. Kanye has spread a lot of disinformation about our private affairs and co-parenting on social media, causing emotional hardship.”</p><h2>Kardashian filed for divorce from West</h2><p>After six years of marriage, Kardashian filed for divorce from West in February 2021. She and West have four children: North, 8; Saint, 6; Chicago, 4. And Psalm 2. The court records were filed more than a month after West’s online rants began in January. The rapper initially came to Instagram to protest that Kardashian had attempted to abduct their daughter, Chicago, on her fourth birthday, despite being forbidden from joining the party hosted for her. In early February, West brought his allegations against Kardashian to the public’s notice once again. In an Instagram post, West asked his fans for advice on what he should do about his daughter, North, using TikTok without his consent.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kim-Kardashian-1-1.jpg alt="Kim Kardashian" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>At the time, he also issued a statement in which he accused Kardashian of “putting a hit out on her.” West uploaded a photo of a chat with Pete Davidson (whom he refers to as Skete) on February 13, swearing that the latter would never meet the children he has with Kardashian, who has been dating the SNL star since October 2021. The rapper intruded on his estranged wife’s privacy once again when he uploaded images of Kardashian pleading with him to stop putting Davidson in “hazardous and terrible” situations on Instagram. He implored followers not to do anything physical to “Skete” in the description of the post. However, West has now erased all of the tweets that have sparked significant outrage since January.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kim-Kardashian-3-1.jpg alt="Kim Kardashian" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Everything you need to know about Kim Kardashian’s new legal filings.</h2><p>Kim complied with Kanye West’s request that she refrain from moving assets out of any trust. The KUWtK alum noted in the documents that she would not have to do so since their prenuptial agreement separates all of their convictions and other assets. West also demanded, for the first time, that Kardashian ‘waive all marital advantages should she remarry’ so that custody concerns may be addressed in court. In the latest document, Kardashian’s attorney responds to the request, stating:</p><p>“Clearly, Mr. West’s purpose here is to block or make Ms. Kardashian’s remarriage difficult.”</p><p>Kanye West’s lawyers, according to Kim Kardashian’s team, are experiencing “challenges in communicating” with him. This echoed Kardashian’s claim in an Instagram post earlier this month that West had to employ three lawyers after filing for divorce a year ago. After the document, Kardashian asked a court to reinstate her single legal status, which she says would help her to “move ahead on a better road” and make co-parenting with West simpler and calmer.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>“divorce is difficult enough on our children and Kanye’s obsession with trying to control and manipulate our situation so negat!vely and publicly is only causing further pain for all”</p><p>Kim Kardashian responds after Kanye’s post about North being on Tiktok without his permission <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/8CJLLM4l6t</a></p><p>— Reality Tving #BBMzansi #BBNaija (@RealityTving) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">February 4, 2022</a></p><p>“While I wish our marriage had succeeded, I have come to realize that there is no way to mend it.” Kanye does not agree, but it looks that he has realized that I want to dissolve our marriage even if he does not.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Kim-Kardashian-4.jpg alt="Kim Kardashian " width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Kim Kardashian<br>The statement went on:</p><p>“I respectfully request that the Court reinstate my status as a single person so that I may begin the healing process and our family can begin the healing process and move ahead in this new chapter in our lives.”</p><p>“They toy with the lives of black guys like that” – Kanye West claimed Kim Kardashian accused him of “placing a hit on her.”</p><p>Kanye West has not responded publicly to what his soon-to-be ex-wife, Kim Kardashian, has said in court records.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiioqVdoK6zsMCsn6KZnmK1or%2BMn6ClnZRirqWwyK2gqKaRoXqku9Srq2aemaG2r7PSZpigmZmjwLV5ypqlsp1drLK0wI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
