Can you imagine five times over, let alone with two dozen children in the mix?</p><p>After watching <a href=#>My Five Wives Season 2 Episode 1</a>, you’re not likely to envy Brady’s life, which is sort of the point of the show, which is revealing and candid.</p><p>One of the wives, Nonie, takes a pregnancy test and it comes back negative. Is this a good thing or a bad thing? The latter, as she openly cries to Brady.</p><p>“Maybe it’s not meant for me anymore,” she says, but Brady jokes that for all 24 kids, all he’s had to do was look at his wife and she got pregnant.</p><span style=display:none>&nbsp;</span><p>This is one fertile individual, that’s for sure. While that has to make her self-conscious, perhaps Nonie just needs a few more tries to add #25 to the mix.</p><p>Sister wife Rosemary spends more time with the kids now that school is out, while Robyn has also finished a semester of school and is writing a book.</p><p>Rhonda is feeling great, but needs a follow-up mammogram. Paulie and Brady are nearing their 23rd wedding anniversary, with their kids leaving the nest.</p><p>Brady and the wives have their weekly organization meeting, which is something you can get used to seeing when you <a href=#>watch My Five Wives online</a>.</p><p>They want to plan a camping trip to celebrate the kids who are graduating, although the logistics of a family of 30 doing that are a bit tougher than for you.</p><p>As the wives reflect on their lives and opportunities missed, Brady reflects on a regret of his own: Not giving Robyn a ring for the couple’s 20th anniversary.</p><p>Of His Five Wives, this is the one he’s had the most trouble with over the years, even though they all worry to a degree if he does love all of them equally.</p><p>The three kids who are off to college go look at apartments. The triplets are still unsure if they want to stay at home or move out, but it’s on the table.</p><p>Nonie talks to Rosemary about the pregnancy situation, and later to her husband, saying she’d love to time their next attempts based on her calendar.</p><p>“You don’t have to give me any warning, I’m good to go,” Brady says.</p><p>Sometimes, being a man has its benefits.</p><p>Lauren does Robyn’s hair in anticipation of a date with Brady, who has a surprise for her. He takes her to a barn, where he presents her with a ring.</p><p>“I’m so excited to get this ring,” Robyn says of the gift that she believes symbolizes much more than that. “It’s not just about this ring, it’s more about us.”</p><p>So is this: Brady reads a poem he wrote about his devotion to her, noting, “I really need to not take any of my wives for granted. They need to be cherished.”</p><p>Later, Rosemary is happy for Robyn and proud that Brady stepped up and did something special, even if Robyn feels like she doesn’t want to gush too much.</p><p>“Honestly, I guess I’m a bit jealous,” Nonie says, echoing that ever-present point and noting that she’s never seen that romantic side of Brady before.</p><p>On the flip side, Paulie looks at it as a good thing that Brady feels he never had to do that for her, which is certainly a positive way of looking at it.</p><p>On the graduation/camping trip, it’s a metaphor for My Five Wives, with everyone doing their own thing and hoping it all comes together, even if it’s hard.</p><p>Amen.</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2psX2Z9cLnYZp2irpVixKrCxKxkrJ2RqLyveZFmnKmho6SxpnmQZqmem5Gleq6xzZ2gp59dlnqurdGroJqflWK8s3nFoq1o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
