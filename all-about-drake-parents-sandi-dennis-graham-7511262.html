His parents, who met at a Toronto nightclub where Dennis was performing in the early ’80s, split when the future Grammy winner was 5 years old. Soon after, Dennis moved back to the United States, driving Drake from Toronto to Memphis with him every summer.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the “God’s Plan” singer has admitted that he feels his parents “could have done a better job” with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>co-parenting in the wake of their split</a>, he’s taking cues from their ups and downs as he navigates co-parenting his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>son Adonis,</a> whom he welcomed with French artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Sophie Brussaux</a> on Oct. 11, 2017.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’m just excited,” Drake <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>previously said about fatherhood</a> during an October 2018 episode of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Lebron James</a>‘ HBO series The Shop. He added that he was pulling from “all of the things I’ve learned from and through my father and the incredible things I’ve learned through my mother about patience, about unconditional love."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite their ups and downs, his parents seem to be in a good place with each other now, with Dennis <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>showing support for his ex-wife</a> at her 75th birthday party in January 2023. “Happy Birthday Pinky, we love you ❤️,” he captioned a family portrait of the former pair posing with Drake and their grandson.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So who are Sandi and Dennis Graham?

He'd also been previously married to a waitress named Virginia, as he told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Office Magazine</a> in 2016, though they'd split by the time he made his first trip to Canada. It was there that he first met Sandi at a show he was playing with Jerry Lee Lewis.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“That’s where I met Drake’s mother. I was at the bar, asking the bartender where I could find cigarettes. So, she goes — Sandi, is her name —&nbsp; she goes, ‘Here, have one of mine.’ And that was it,” he told the outlet. He then moved to Toronto and married Sandi in June 1985, before welcoming Drake the following October.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-drake-was-almost-given-a-different-name></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Drake was almost given a different name</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It turns out that Drake’s full name, Aubrey Drake Graham, was a compromise. Sandi was raised Jewish, and according to Dennis, her mother wanted Drake’s name to be Abraham. Dennis wasn’t on board with the moniker, so they settled on Aubrey instead, while Dennis chose his middle name after himself.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“And I named him Drake,” he told Office Magazine, explaining he previously used Drake Madison as his stage name while acting under Lee Strasberg in Los Angeles and Toronto.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-they-split-when-he-was-5></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>They split when he was 5</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Drake Instagram</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sandi and Dennis’ marriage was short-lived, with Sandi taking full custody of Drake by 1991.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the wake of their split, Drake lived with his mom and mainly saw his dad in the summers. “I was really hard on my parents for giving me sort of a childhood that I had to wrap my mind around as I grew,” Drake said on his The Shop appearance. “Multiple times I sort of suggested that they could have done a better job at co-parenting, sticking together, not being so divided.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now a single father himself, Drake hopes to set a better example for his son Adonis.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I am a single father learning to communicate with a woman who, we’ve had our moments,” the artist said of his relationship with Brussaux. “No matter what happens, I have unconditional love for the mother of my child because I want him to love his mother and I have to project that energy.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I didn’t come from that [peace],” Drake continued. “I came from my mother being like, ‘Your dad is this.’ My dad would never speak ill of my mother — ever, ever, ever. My mother is the nicest, kindest, sweetest woman, but she’s a woman scorned and a woman who is exhausted."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-drakes-dad-is-also-a-musician></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Drake’s dad is also a musician</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Prince Williams/FilmMagic</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Formerly a drummer for his band, Dennis Graham and the North Memphis Band, as well as for Jerry Lee Lewis, Dennis has had a career in music for several decades. Starting in 2016, he began to focus on music once again, this time as a singer and songwriter with a more R&B style.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After releasing his first single, “Kinda Crazy,” as well as a corresponding music video in 2016, he went on to record a few more tracks. On Father’s Day in 2021, he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>surprised fans with a song</a> inspired by his relationship with Drake, called “Father and Son,” which honors the unbreakable bond the two share.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“A father and son will always understand each other's heart/ And they'll always sit together/ Until it's all said and done/ So there's nothing/ No, there's nothing in the world/ Like a love between a father and son,” he sings in part.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to lessons he’s shared with Drake from his own career in the music industry, Dennis says that he’s taught Drake “how to be humble” — but that otherwise, the rapper has done it all on his own.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I thought I was going to have to help him when he first started,” Dennis <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told Fader</a> in 2016 of Drake’s rise to superstardom. “I thought I should be there to help him and make sure that he's not being taken advantage of or anything like that.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He soon discovered he wasn’t needed. “He was extremely smart about what he was doing and knew every step that he was taking,” Dennis added. “So I never had to worry about him again ever.

At the same time, he revealed he was wiring money to his dad and trying to quell the feeling that came with it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Dedicated to my mom and I swear my word is bond/ Everything will be okay and it won't even take that long,” he sings. Later in the song, he talks about “feeling guilty and ashamed” after his dad calls him out for buying expensive cars while he can hardly afford cigarettes. “Damn, and I can only feel his pain/ 'Cause in Memphis, Tennessee there's only so much to attain/ So I'm filling out the form at the counter once again/ He say he love me, I just hope he doesn't say that s— in vain.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2015’s “You & The 6,” Drake raps to Sandi as a confessional, opening up about his struggles with fame and telling her, “You and the six [his hometown of Toronto] raised me right, that s— saved my life.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He opens up about his parents’ strained relationship in the song as well, quoting Sandi as saying, “ ‘You’re your father’s child man, thank God you got some me in you,’/ At least I always, at least I always see it through,” he sings, referring to how Sandi “raised me alone.” Later in the track, he opens up about him and Sandi finding forgiveness for Dennis leaving them. “Girl he love you to death/ He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept/ But he just want our forgiveness, and f— it look how we living/ I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Beyond his more emotional confessions, perhaps the most famous line Drake has penned for a parent is from “God’s Plan,” — with the instantly viral, “I only love my bed and my momma, I’m sorry.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-drake-has-tattoos-honoring-his-parents--and-his-dad-returned-the-favor></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Drake has tattoos honoring his parents — and his dad returned the favor</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>champagnepapi/Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-68 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Drake’s love for his family is no secret, and in addition to cataloging it in his songs, he’s also permanently inked the proof onto his body. The Degrassi alum has photos of his late uncle and grandmother tattooed, as well as a mugshot of his father and a photo of his mom on his back.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In August 2022, he added a front-and-center new addition to his collection (which numbers over two dozen), <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>getting his mom’s initials tattooed on his face</a>. He opted for the letters “SG,” which stand for Sandra Gale, in small script just beneath his eye. He shared a photo of the new ink to Instagram, while <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>tattoo artist Nal</a> posted a video from their session.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2017, Dennis took a cue from his son and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>got a large, close-up portrait of the rapper</a> tattooed on his bicep. Years later, Drake commented on the ink, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>poking fun at his dad</a> for its likeness.

Drake has been honest about feeling abandoned by his dad in his youth, often rapping about himself and his mom struggling together in the wake of his dad’s absence.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-82 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It's our world, it's just us two,” he sings on 2011’s “Look What You’ve Done,” where he reveals that things would get heated with his mom when she’d compare him to his father, prompting Drake to threaten to move out of her house. “My one button, you push it,” he sings.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later in the song, he raps about his dad living in Memphis and not being able to visit him after missing child support payments. “And my father living in Memphis now, he can't come this way/ Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid, damn/ Boo-hoo, sad story — Black American dad story.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dennis <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>has expressed his frustration</a> with Drake’s portrayal of their relationship on multiple occasions, insisting to Office that their relationship “has always been good” and that he “got on [Drake]” about the lyrics “that made people think that we were not close.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-88 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“He goes, ‘Dad.

The rapper shared a photo of himself twinning (complete with a fake beard!) beside Dennis in matching white tops, glasses, gold necklaces and Dennis’ signature knitted cap. “Not planned,” he playfully captioned the since-deleted snap.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-drake-is-a-certified-mamas-boy></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-104 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text><strong>Drake is a certified mama's boy</strong></span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-105 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jemal Countess/WireImage&nbsp;</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-106 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It’s no secret that Drake loves his mom unconditionally.
