The disgraced comedian was convicted of three counts of aggravated indecent assault and sentenced to three-to-ten years in a Pennsylvania state prison. Sixty women have accused Cosby of a range of assaults – from rape, sexual battery, or sexual misconduct. In 2020, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections released <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>an updated mugshot</a> of the then-83-year-old Cosby, revealing grey hair and sallow skin.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7><strong><strong>Phylicia Rashad (“Clair Huxtable”)</strong></strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/The-Cosby-Show-Cast-Then-And-Now-embed-8.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Considered one of the most prominent “moms” on television (and one of the most high-profile Black mothers in pop culture), <strong>Phylicia Rashad </strong>brought structure and stability to The Cosby Show as Clair Huxtable. After The Cosby Show’s final episode in 1992, she returned to the stage. She made history in 2004. Her performance as Lena Younger in a revival of A Raisin In the Sun won her the Tony for Best Leading Actress In A Play, the first Black actress to do so, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Today</a>.

As Denise, Lisa was given her own spin-off, A Different World, but her performance in the first season received mixed reviews. Ahead of season two, Lisa and then-husband <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lenny Kravitz </strong></a>announced that they were expecting.
