They share sons Alexander “Sasha,” 9, and Samuel, 7.</p><p>Asked whether the change in their relationship status is scary to him, Schreiber replied, “Yeah. Of course it is. We’re parents together, so we’ll be together for the rest of our lives no matter what, and we’re very close. Hopefully that never changes, and I don’t think it will.”&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier in the interview, the <i>Spotlight </i>actor revealed he chose his role in the Broadway revival of<i> Les Liaisons Dangereuses</i> to be near his family. “I wanted to be close to the kids, and I wanted to pick a job that would put me in New York and keep me in New York, and this was a job that was in the city, and it kept me around the kids,” he said. “The problem is you have no time to be with them on a theater schedule.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/liev-schreiber-naomi-watts-9d56be21-af32-4244-9c46-5b87a9a32e70.jpg><p>King later offered to set up the newly single star, to which he joked, “I’m busy with the 15-year-old,” referencing the teen that his character seduces in his Broadway show.&nbsp;</p><p>Schreiber’s comments about the split echoed what Watts, 48, said earlier this week when <a href=#>she broke her silence about their breakup</a>. “I feel, whether you’re famous or not, transitions are scary for anybody,” the <i>St. Vincent </i>actress told Australia’s <i>Daily Telegraph</i>. “I feel like change is always scary, but that’s only because transition for anyone is new, and you wonder how things are going to go.”</p><span class=caption></span><p><a href=#>The pair have stayed amicable </a>since they called it quits. Back in September, they told <i>Us Weekly</i> in a joint statement: “Over the past few months we’ve come to the conclusion that the best way forward for us as a family is to separate as a couple. It is with great love, respect and friendship in our hearts that we look forward to raising our children together and exploring this new phase of our relationship. While we appreciate your curiosity and support, we ask the press to be mindful of our children and respect their right to privacy.”&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaloZWrerSvx6ucopqVp3qisMOrnKyrlah6r63OpqBmr5GpwbR50qmjoqxdm7yzedOhnGaemafAtXnToqSeZadpgnR%2BlG5m</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
