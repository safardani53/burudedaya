After watching a <a href=#>wild installment of <i>The Bachelor</i></a><i></i> on Monday, January 9,<i> The Bachelorette </i>season 6 star <b><a href=#>Ali Fedotowsky</a></b> took to her <a href=#><i>Ali Luvs</i></a> blog on January 10 to weigh in on the sexy scenes.</p><p>The ABC dating series’ latest episode included <b><a href=#>Nick Viall</a></b> and a group of ladies taking part in a bridal-themed photo shoot, where <b>Brittany</b>‘s outfit consisted solely of a leaf-print bikini bottom with her hair covering her breasts. In an effort to steal the spotlight, <b>Corinne</b> later took off her own top in the pool and put Viall’s hands on her boobs.</p><p>“I was a bit shocked by how some of the girls were behaving (although I probably shouldn’t have been),” wrote Fedotowsky, 32, who welcomed 6-month-old daughter Molly with fiancé <b>Kevin Manno</b> in July. She explained that while Viall seemed attracted to Corinne, he probably didn’t appreciated that Corinne appeared to want to make the other women upset with her very public advances.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“Overall, I am pretty disappointed with how some of the girls are handling themselves,” the <i>Bachelor</i> season 14 standout wrote. “Brittany asked Nick whose boobs were better — hers or Corrine’s. Corrine got naked on her first date. And <b>Lacey </b>said, ‘What if I had taken my shirt off — would I have gotten the rose?’ I know she was trying to make a point suggesting that’s what Nick wants (and I think Lacey is very sweet). But in general, there is just too much focus on sexuality this season already.”</p><p>“Even the boob birthday thing at the end,” she continued about <b>Alexis</b>‘ cupcake celebration. “It was funny, and I can appreciate humor, but again, it seems like too much for it only being the second episode. As a mom, I sat there and watched the showing, thinking, ‘I never want my daughter to think she has to behave this way to find a good man.’ I’m not trying to put the girls down by calling them out on this either. It just makes me sad, I guess. I hope they all know they are better than this.”</p><p>As fans remember, Fedotowsky was the third runner-up on <b>Jake Pavelka</b>‘s season 14 of <i>The Bachelor</i>, and she and <i>Bachelorette</i> pick <b>Roberto Martinez</b> called off their engagement in November 2011.</p><p>Tell <i>Us:</i> Do you think Fedotowsky has a point?</p><p><i>The Bachelor</i> airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJiloV2bsqW706iurKOpYrGqv8Cpp6ihnqmypXnWoquhZZKWsKmxy6ipZqaZmLhuwsiao6WrXaGupbXErGSwbGZlgXSAjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
