Jolie completed her look with a string of pearls and a gold clutch as she entered the White House with her and ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Brad Pitt</strong></a>’s <a href=#>21-year-old son</a>. Maddox, for his part, looked dapper in a black suit that featured a long jacket.</p><p class=p1>The twosome were photographed schmoozing with other guests when they attended<a href=#> <strong>President Joe Biden</strong></a>’s <a href=#>star-studded evening</a> to welcome the arrival of the president of South Korea, <strong>Yoon Suk Yeol</strong>.</p><p class=p3>Jolie — who <a href=#>serves as a special envoy of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a> — has long been vocal about politics and <a href=#>promoting female empowerment</a>.</p><p class=p3>“Women contribute so much, they are giving, are nurturing by nature, are community-building by nature, are strong, are intelligent, and yet what is it that’s holding us back?” Jolie said <a href=#>during a July 2020 panel with the National Democratic Institute</a>. “I think when you speak of value, that’s something to really sit with. Why is it that so many women still&nbsp;don’t know their own value?”</p><p class=p3>In addition to Maddox, Jolie and Pitt, 59, share <a href=#>Pax, 19, Zahara, 18, Shiloh, 16, and twins Vivienne and Knox, both 14</a>. While the <i>Salt&nbsp;</i>star and the&nbsp;<i>Fight Club&nbsp;</i>actor split in 2016, Jolie has <a href=#>made sure their children are her No. 1 priority</a> as she and Pitt<a href=#> continue a messy custody and divorce battle</a>.</p><p class=p3>“She’s a very invested mom. She’s on it. She’s on it with these kids. She gives them love every second of their day,” Jolie’s father, <a href=#><strong>Jon Voight</strong></a>, <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>in February 2019</a>. “She’s very smart too. Smart girl. Brave. She’s got all these great qualities.”</p><p class=p3>The California native has also loved bragging about her kids, including Maddox and his educational pursuits.&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>previously confirmed in 2019 that <a href=#>the young adult had enrolled at South Korea’s Yonsei University</a> to study biochemistry.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p3>“I’m so happy for [Maddox] that [he has]&nbsp;grown up into such a good man,” the&nbsp;<i>Eternals&nbsp;</i>star <a href=#>gushed to&nbsp;<i>Entertainment Tonight</i>&nbsp;that&nbsp;October</a>.&nbsp;“I&nbsp;say that because he’s smart and he’s doing his work, but he’s also wild. He’s&nbsp;balanced in his teenage years.”</p><p class=p3>Scroll below to see photos of Jolie and Maddox’s night out at the White House State Dinner:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkrq%2BzxKWgp5ldn7yttcRmqqimXaKupbDOsWSarKSau6V51qGgrZ1dnby2v8Rmqq2ZpJp6pbXNp5yrZaCesLR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
