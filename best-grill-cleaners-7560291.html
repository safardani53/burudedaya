It doesn’t matter whether you have a gas grill, charcoal grill, or even an electric indoor grill — you’ve got to keep the grates clean and the interior free of grease and debris to get the best results and stay safe while cooking.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The good news is that it’s not hard to clean your grill — it should only take a minute or two each time you cook. However, you do need the right equipment to get the job done right. “For cleaning my grill, high heat and a good grill brush is what makes the difference,” says Kevin Hoffmann, executive chef at Vinyl Steakhouse in NYC. “After cooking, I let the grill top get as hot as possible and hit it with the brush. After, I wipe it with a mute oil, such as canola oil, so it doesn't rust.” In addition to a good grill brush, you may also want to invest in a cleaning spray, which can help cut through built-up grease on the grates or inside the grill body.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To help you sort through all the options out there today, we asked grilling pros what grill cleaners they use on their own grills, and we put together this list of expert-recommended products to add to your arsenal.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Here are the best grill cleaners, according to grilling experts.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-grill-brush-kona-safeclean-grill-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall Grill Brush</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Kona Safe/Clean Grill Brush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Kona safe clean grill brush" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/KWdMEhIFufS-JnpLCVYLOaXydv0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kona-safeclean-grill-brush-112d884310fb4c3b84c97fb468c6accf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">A good grill brush is a must-have, no matter what type of grill you use, and this one comes highly recommended by Shannon Snell, pitmaster at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Sonny’s BBQ</a>.

It has a durable stainless steel handle, and the nylon bristles are stiff enough to scrape gunk off your grill (but still safer than metal bristles). Plus, it has a second handle on the back of the brush head (allowing you to get more leverage for tough, stuck-on messes) and a metal scraper on the front edge.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Pro tip</strong>: This Traeger grill brush is designed to be used when your grill is off to protect the nylon bristles from the heat, and you can replace the brush head when it wears down, saving you from having to buy a whole new tool.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Type: </strong>Brush | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 15.75 x 5.9 inches | <strong>Material:</strong> Stainless steel with nylon bristles</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-wire-free-grill-brush-grill-rescue-bbq-grill-brush></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Wire-Free Grill Brush</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Grill Rescue BBQ Grill Brush</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Grill Rescue Grill Brush with Scraper" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/JYXmzONMgk4BIQQxIvsVyNDbDG0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Grill-Rescue-Grill-Brush-with-Scraper-842e817737134697842f2e22a0c3c281.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Want to avoid bristles all together? You’re not the only one! “I prefer to use a product like Grill Rescue that utilizes a strong cloth pad and water to create steam that cleans your grill," says Carey Bringle, founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Peg Leg Porker</a> in Nashville. This popular grill brush has a unique fabric head that’s made from aramid — the heat-resistant fabric used in firefighter gear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Pro tip: </strong>When dipped in water, it’s great for cleaning hot grill grates, and the tough material can even be put through the dishwasher for easy cleaning.

While the brush features natural palmyra fibers, which come from palm trees, it’s still sturdy enough to remove food and grease from your grill.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“The bristles are stiff, like you'd want from a grill brush, without being metal,” explains Wes Wright, founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Cookout News</a>. “There have been too many cases of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>metal bristles falling off of brushes</a> and ending up in food, which is really dangerous.

This model is recommended by Leslie Klemm, culinary director at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>The Pharmacy Burger</a> in Nashville, as it has a wide 6-inch blade and a knob grip that lets you apply more pressure to the surface.

The gel spray is effective at removing caked-on food and grime, as well as grease, and it will minimize the amount of scrubbing needed to get your grill clean.

Grill brushes are the most popular, as they tend to be the most quick and effective way to remove food and grease from grill grates. No matter what type of grill you own, a high-quality grill brush is a worthwhile investment for your cleaning kit.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to a grill brush, you may want to invest in a grill cleaning spray, which can help remove tough messes. However, most of our experts recommend using sprays only on the interior components and outside of your grill — not the grates.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Finally, there are cleaning tools like scrapers, which are ideal for griddle surfaces, and ash vacuums, which are handy for cleaning out charcoal grills.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Grill Style</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The best grill cleaner for your needs will largely depend on what kind of grill you own. For those with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>gas grills</a>, a good grill brush is often enough for everyday maintenance. However, if you have a grill that burns fuel, such as a pellet or<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2> charcoal grill</a>, you’ll also need to regularly clean out ash from the body. In these situations, a special grill vacuum, like the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Stanley Ash Vacuum</a>, will make the job much easier.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">You’ll also want to consider the type of grates in your grill. Stainless steel grates are often the easiest to care for, as you don’t need to worry about them getting scratched or rusty. Cast iron grates are very durable, but they need to be regularly oiled to keep them in good condition and prevent rust. If you have enamel-coated grates, you’ll want a softer bristle brush (or one with no bristles at all, like the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Grill Rescue BBQ Grill Brush</a>) to prevent the coating from chipping.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Safety</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There are a few important safety considerations to keep in mind as you shop for a grill cleaner. All of the experts we talked to recommended avoiding grill brushes with metal bristles, which can fall out during use. This can be quite dangerous if the bristles get stuck in your food, and there are plenty of non-bristle options available today that will clean your grill just as well.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to grill cleaning sprays, you’ll want to look at the ingredients, as well as the directions for use. While many are technically safe to use on grill grates, our experts recommend against it. If not completely rinsed off, the cleaner could end up in your food, and even if it’s non-toxic, you don’t want to ingest the substance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Russell Kilgore</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-41aded81-c2a3-41f3-bb4f-f834bfb61034></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=48.427672955975><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.94846382556987><p><span class=accordion__title>What’s the best way to clean a dirty grill?</span></p><p>To clean a dirty grill, you’re going to need a sturdy grill brush, such as the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Kona Safe/Clean Grill Brush</a>, and a container full of fresh water. You can clean your grill before or after use — if you clean it before, let the grill heat up for several minutes before you start to clean, and if you clean it after, do it while the grates are still hot.&nbsp;</p><p>The process is simple: Dip your grill brush into the water, then begin scrubbing back and forth along the grates. The water should sizzle and steam, helping to release baked-on food and grease. You may need to employ a scraper, such as the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Cuisinart Griddle Scraper</a>, if there are stubborn bits that won’t come loose.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to cleaning the grates after every use, you’ll also want to clean out the grease trap — some grills have disposable liners that make this easier — and oil the cooking surface. “I also use disposable rags and vegetable oil after cleaning to re-season,” says Figueroa.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.96597353497164><p><span class=accordion__title>Will Dawn clean grill grates?</span></p><p>Dawn dish soap is great for removing grease, and it can come in handy if you need to deep clean your grill grates. You’ll want to remove the grates from the grill and scrub them using a mixture of Dawn and warm water. This can be done with a stiff brush or sponge, and you may need to use another cleaner like <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Bar Keepers Friend</a> if there are extra-tough stains. After the grates have dried, be sure to oil them to keep the surface conditioned and prevent food from sticking the next time you cook.<br></p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What can you use instead of a grill brush?</span></p><p>If you’ve misplaced your grill brush but need to clean off your grates, there are a few items you can use in a pinch. “For day-to-day grill cleaning, I use a ball of wadded-up aluminum foil and lots of elbow grease,” says Figueroa. This works the best if your grill is warm, but you’ll need to be careful to keep your hands safely away from the grates as you scrub.</p><p>Believe it or not, onions are another effective tool for cleaning grill grates. All you have to do is cut an onion in half and rub the cut side over the grates. It will loosen up stuck bits of food and also provide a little extra flavor to whatever you’re cooking.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-take-our-word-for-it></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Take Our Word For It</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Camryn Rabideau</a> is a freelance writer and product tester, and over the course of her career, she has tested close to a dozen different grills and smokers, as well as a variety of grill brushes and other cleaners.
