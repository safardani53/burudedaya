So we brought on 50,000 temps in a very short amount of time. We were able to get people from getting an application form to starting work in four hours," says Tony.</p><p>Tony Hoggett, Group Chief Operating Officer, said: “We had to recruit really, really quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>“So we brought on 50,000 temps in a very short amount of time.
