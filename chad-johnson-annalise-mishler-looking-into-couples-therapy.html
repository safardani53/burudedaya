He was taken into custody at 4:10 a.m. and booked for “robbery with a domestic violence enhancement,” an LAPD spokesperson said.</p><p>The night before, Mishler posted multiple Instagram Stories explaining what had happened, claiming he got drunk for the first time in 50 days and <a href=#>punched a hole in her wall</a>. A source later told Us that he took her phone away and chucked it over a fence when she attempted to call 911</p><p>“I was completely out of character when I punched the wall, yelled and was aggressive. I was just spiraling from stress and having lost my relationship with Annalise that morning,” he shared with Us, admitting that he had relapsed. “I made a promise to myself and to Annalise to no longer drink.”</p><p>In his apology video, posted on February 26, Johnson denied “any domestic abuse of any kind,” claiming that <a href=#>he has “never laid hands on a woman” in his life</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I was in the Marine core; I was taught core values. I have a sister. I am a very overprotective brother. If she ever felt in danger, I would want her to call,” the Famously Single star said in the video. “If any women out there ever feel like they are in any danger I urge you to call 911. I can totally understand why Annalise felt threatened whenever I took her phone, but I am 100 percent confident [that] any type of domestic abuse charges are going to be dropped because there was never any time of domestic abuse at all whatsoever. Never laid my hands on a woman.”</p><p>Mishler, through it all, has <a href=#>remained worried about Johnson</a>, she told Us.
