A-listers in the industry have also voiced their sorrow, with many describing George Shapiro as a “gentle soul” who was always eager and encouraging.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>One of the dearest people I have ever known, George Shapiro, just passed. I bless our friendship and, at 99, I’m sure I’ll see him relatively soon. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/3JGipf1P93</a></p><p>— Norman Lear (@TheNormanLear) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">May 28, 2022</a></p><h2>A brief history of George Shapiro and his works</h2><p>During his adolescence, George Shapiro worked as a lifeguard at the Tamiment Resort in the Poconos, where he met performers such as Dick Shawn, Pat Carroll, and Carol Burnett, as well as singer Barbara Cook and dancer Herb Ross. During this period, he also met talent agents.</p><p>He said in an interview with the Television Academy Foundation:</p><p>“These men showed up… I had no idea what an agency was, but they came to witness the event and chat to the ladies and comedians. ‘Is this your job?’ I asked. To see the play, enjoy a good supper, or visit a lakeside resort? I’ll have to check into it.”</p><p>After graduating from NYU and serving in the Army, Shapiro got an interview for a job in the mailroom at William Morris in New York via his uncle, Carl Reiner. He worked as a junior agent in the firm’s packaging department, earning $38 a week, but he remained involved in comedy, seeing Lenny Bruce, Mike Nichols, Elaine May, and Phyllis Diller perform in New York. He also convinced West, a PS 80 acquaintance, to join him at the agency.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/George-Shapiro-2.jpg alt="George Shapiro" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Shapiro and West moved to Los Angeles a few years later, where he worked as a television packager on series such as The Steve Allen Show, That Girl, and Gomer Pyle USMC.

He was also behind a slew of other TV comedy specials, including Showtime’s Broadway Baby, which starred Elayne Boosler, HBO’s Stand-Up Confidential, which included Seinfeld, and Reiner and Mel Brooks’ animated classic The 2000 Year Old Man.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/George-Shapiro-3.jpg alt="George Shapiro" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Comedian, Summer Rental, and Summer School are among the feature films produced by Shapiro.
