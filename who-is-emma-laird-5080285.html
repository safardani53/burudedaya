The British heartthrob, 32, who dated the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>breakup-anthem queen</a>&nbsp;for over <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>six years</a>, however, was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spotted</a> with his The Brutalist costar <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Emma Laird</strong></a> in Hungary around the same time as the surprising split. Emma also <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shared</a> a snap of Joe to her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram </a>just a few weeks after the breakup, which caused a storm of Swiftie backlash (more on that below). Let’s learn about Emma, below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/emma-laird-5-things-ev-embed.jpg><h2>Emma Is Working With Hollywood Heavyweights</h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>The Scottish actress, born September 8, 1998, almost gave up her acting career when she lost out on the reboot of Gossip Girl, per <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Variety</a>. She decided to give it another go, sell her house and take more acting lessons. She soon landed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mayor of Kingstown</a> alongside <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jeremy Renner</strong></a>. And with the upcoming movie The Brutalist, she shares the screen with stars likes of <strong>Adrien Brody, Guy Pearce, </strong>and<strong> Felicity Jones</strong>.</p><h2>She’s Also A Model</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Just a quick glance at her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> and its obvious Emma has made a living off her natural beauty! The starlet is a gorgeous muse for the best and brightest in the fashion industry. As one fan put it in the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>comment section</a>, “What can’t you do?!?! Model, superstar actress, singer… and just an epic person!!!!”</p><h2>Emma Rocks A Guitar Like Taylor Swift</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>If it’s any indication on her social media, Emma has a great group of friends to keep her grounded. In one Instagram <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>post</a>, the beauty rocked a tee that read “Tilda Swinton” while she held up a Bud Light in a bottle, along with what appeared to be a cigarette.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Emma is also a badass musician just like Joe’s ex! The young star showed off her prowess with a guitar on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>. When a fan requested her to play a “Taylor Swift song next,” another fan coyly added, “She’s cosplaying Taylor Swift with Joe already.’</p><h2>She Reportedly Has ‘Been There’ For Joe Amid His Breakup</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>While they were working together on the film, Joe and Emma reportedly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>hung out in Hungary together</a>. A source told&nbsp;<a class=class href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Sun,</a> “Emma has been there for Joe since news of his split from Taylor emerged. Joe struggles with fame and enjoyed hanging out with Emma in Hungary, where he wouldn’t be recognized.”</p><h2>Emma’s Scooter Snap Of Joe Caused A Major Swiftie Backlash</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>After Emma shared a snap of Joe <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>standing by electric scooters</a>, Taylor’s fans claimed it was a dig at his famous ex, because of her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>feud with <strong>Scooter Braun</strong></a>. Her comment section was flooded with vicious responses like, “Lady I hope youre not proud for being the other woman to a boring poor man” and “Read the room omg Swifties are coming for you,” per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>BuzzFeed</a>. Emma ended up turning off the comments on the post.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2KyrrnAZqOaoaKZenZ8l2lpcW1f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 SwayBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
